Kevin Owens  ( search ), who is leading the force in the southern sector. He said that while the Afghan army is motivated and courageous, the command and control systems, along with their maintenance and logistical operations still need improvement. He could not put a timeline on when they will be ready. Owens commented after Afghanistan President  Hamid Karzai  ( search ) said airstrikes are no longer effective and there is not as great a need for foreign military operations there. But President Bush said Thursday that the 18,000 U.S. troops serving in the country have not yet finished their mission. Speaking from southern Afghanistan to reporters in the Pentagon, Owens said there are about 800  Taliban  ( search ) insurgents left in remote sections of southern Afghanistan where they have been able to hide. While he acknowledged there has been more violence in the region in recent months, he said it has been due to attacks by his forces. \"We have had more contact with the enemy, we've certainly destroyed more enemy combatants in the last six months, but again, it is on our terms,\" he said. \"We have put them on their heels. I believe the enemy is reeling from our recent operations.\" He said the ongoing operations and the recent successful Afghanistan elections have eroded the enemy's ability to launch coordinated attacks, and have lessened their contact with the Afghan population.", "date": "2015-03-25"},
{"description": "Hussain Osman, aka Hamdi Issac, began his trial in Great Britain.", "author": "| Associated Press", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/story/london-bombing-suspect-trial-begins", "title": "London Bombing Suspect Trial Begins", "content": "LONDON \u2013  It was a busy day in Britain's crackdown on terror: A suspect in failed bomb attacks on the London transit system appeared in court. A Muslim convert was sentenced to 15 years in a separate case. And police arrested a man near planes at Manchester airport and exploded his suitcase. Also, the wife of one of the four suspected  July 7  ( search ) homicide bombers said in an interview published Friday that her late husband was a \"naive\" man whose mind was poisoned by his contacts with Britain's radical mosques. A day after his extradition from Italy, Ethiopian-born  Hussain Osman  ( search ), charged in the July 21 attempt to bomb the London Underground, made his first appearance at the high-security court at Belmarsh prison. Osman, also known as Hamdi Isaac, seemed calm as he stood behind thick glass, guarded by four bailiffs at the back of the courtroom. He spoke briefly, confirming his name and saying that he understood the proceedings. A magistrate denied Osman's bail application and set his next court appearance for Dec. 8. The hearing came after Osman lost a two-month legal battle to avoid extradition from Italy to face British charges including conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder and possession of explosives. He was flown to London on Thursday. Osman allegedly fled to Italy in the days after the bombings and was arrested in Rome. He has said through his lawyer that the bombing attempt was meant to scare people, not kill them. Osman is believed to have been the man captured on closed-circuit television footage attempting to bomb the Shepherd's Bush subway station July 21. Three other men \u2014  Ibrahim Muktar Said  ( search ), 27,  Ramzi Mohamed  ( search ), 23, and  Yassin Omar  ( search ), 24, all from London \u2014 are in jail awaiting a November court appearance. No one was killed in the four near-simultaneous attempted attacks, which came two weeks after the July 7 blasts that killed 56 people, including the bombers. As that case got started, another was came to close. In London, court convicted  Andrew Rowe  ( search ), 34, of having a notebook containing details on how to fire a mortar and a code that could be used to communicate about potential terror targets. Justice Adrian Fulford sentenced Rowe to consecutive sentences of 7 1/2 years on each of two counts. \"You were a paid operative over a substantial period of time, traveling the world and furthering the cause of Muslim fundamentalism,\" the judge said. Rowe \u2014 who converted to Islam after a troubled youth and reportedly made trips to Morocco, Pakistan and Afghanistan \u2014 was arrested in October 2003 near the tunnel that runs under the English Channel, connecting Britain and France. Prosecutors said traces of high explosives were found on a pair of socks in his luggage on the French side of the Chunnel, but they never linked him to a specific terrorist plot. Meanwhile, in the Manchester airport arrest, an unidentified man was seen carrying a suitcase and walking under a plane, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported. A bomb squad later carried out a controlled explosion of the suitcase, which turned out to contain only clothing, papers and a passport, police said. Police initially detained the man under anti-terrorism legislation, but a spokesman said later that his status had changed and he was now being held under the Mental Health Act. The arrest caused several flights in and out of the airport to be delayed briefly, National Air Traffic Services said. The airport, which serves more than 19 million passengers per year, says it ranks as the 12th busiest in Europe. Speaking to The Sun tabloid, the wife of one of the July 7 bombers,  Jermaine Lindsay  ( search ), said her husband had fallen under the influence of radical mosques in Luton and London. Samantha Lewthwaite, whose husband also used the name Jamal, did not identify any mosque by name. \"How these people could have turned him and poisoned his mind is dreadful,\" the newspaper quoted her as saying. \"He was an innocent, naive and simple man. I suppose he must have been an ideal candidate. \"He was so angry when he saw Muslim civilians being killed on the streets of Iraq, Bosnia, Palestine and Israel \u2014 and always said it was the innocent who suffered.\" Lindsay is suspected of detonating the bomb that killed 26 people and himself on the Piccadilly Underground line. British tabloids often pay people for interviews, but it wasn't immediately clear if the newspaper paid Lewthwaite. Lewthwaite, 21, who like her husband was a convert to Islam, gave birth to the couple's second child, a daughter, on July 22, 15 days after the bombings. Their son is now 17 months old. \"Jamal is accountable for his actions 100 percent and I condemn with all my heart what he has done,\" Lewthwaite was quoted as saying. \"I will try to remember for my children's sake the Jamal I loved and raise them knowing their father was a man who truly loved them. But the day will come when I'll have to tell them what he did.\"", "date": "2015-03-25"},

The news that the  Securities and Exchange Commission  is looking into Frist's sale of stock in HCA Inc., the hospital operating company founded by his family, comes as a criminal investigation continues of Jack Abramoff, a high-powered Republican lobbyist, and his ties to DeLay. Less than a week ago, a former White House official was arrested in the  Abramoff  ( search ) investigation. For Republicans, the timing couldn't be worse. \"The last thing you needed was a Martha Stewart problem,\"  Marshall Wittman  ( search ), a one-time conservative activist who now works for the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, said of Frist. \"He doesn't even have a good clothing line or a popular television show.\" Stewart, the homemaking doyenne, served five months in federal prison for lying to authorities about a stock deal and nearly six months more in home confinement. The midterm elections occur in just over 13 months and Republicans face the historic reality that the party controlling the White House typically loses seats in non-presidential years. Shadowing the GOP outlook is President Bush's diminishing approval ratings as the war in Iraq and the need for billions in federal spending after devastating hurricanes threaten to overwhelm a second-term agenda. \"It may not cost the Republicans any seats directly, but it's something they don't need right now,\" said John J. Pitney, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who once worked as a research analyst for House Republicans. \"They've got plenty of problems as it is.\" Still, in the Republican-controlled Congress, Democrats have more Senate seats to defend \u2014 17 to the GOP's 15 \u2014 and redistricting has made fewer House seats competitive. Charlie Black, a Republican consultant with close ties to the White House, expects Frist to be cleared by next year and any whiff of scandal to be gone. \"I suspect the DeLay matter and this matter will be resolved long before November '06,\" Black said. Frist cultivated a political outsider image when he ran for the Senate in 1994. \"I don't want a career in Washington. I want change,\" said the Tennessee heart surgeon, who didn't register to vote until 1988 and didn't vote until he was 36. The year 1994 marked the Republican revolution, when the GOP seized control of Congress after decades of Democratic rule in the House and years in the Senate. The GOP portrayed their rivals as beholden to special interests and corrupt after years of entrenchment. More than a decade later, Republicans are trying to avoid the perception that they resemble the Democrats they replaced. \"The overall problem the Republican Party has is it is increasingly looking like Tammany Hall,\" Wittman said. \"An odor of sleaziness is enveloping the Republicans and seeping into the administration.\" The challenge for Frist is to clear his name in a federal investigation while trying to maintain his hold on the post of Senate majority leader. Frist came to power in 2002 when Republicans forced out Sen.  Trent Lott  ( search ), R-Miss., after he made racially tinged remarks in support of former Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., a one-time segregationist. If Republicans see Frist and the SEC probe as a drag, he could suffer the same fate as Lott. Frist also is a lame-duck leader who has indicated he won't seek another term. Chris Lehane, a Democratic consultant who has managed scandals, said Frist's political strategy would be to get information out, but that approach is hardly what a lawyer would advise his client. An insider trader investigation also raises the possibility of civil action by shareholders and a discovery process that \"disgorges all kinds of documents,\" Lehane said. \"Even information benign in another type of environment \u2014 what about this phone message from your brother\" \u2014 has added significance, Lehane said. Frist has been mentioned as a potential presidential candidate in 2008 \u2014 a prospect that looks less likely with the federal probe and his break with conservatives on embryonic stem-cell research. \"That romance was over before it started,\" Wittman said.", "date": "2015-03-25"},
{"description": "An industry group said it doesn't believe that the possibility of a financial crisis in the nation's worker pensions system is overstated.", "author": "| Associated Press", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/story/industry-group-doubts-pension-system-crisis", "title": "Industry Group Doubts Pension System Crisis", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013  Warnings of a financial crisis in the nation's worker pensions system are overstated, an industry group said Friday as Congress prepared legislation to overhaul the system to protect future retirees' benefits. The liabilities of the federal agency that guarantees worker pensions, estimated at $23.3 billion at the end of 2004, are inflated by excessively low interest rate assumptions and overly conservative investment strategies, according to a report prepared for the  American Benefits Council  ( search ), which represents companies with defined benefit pension plans. There's no dispute that the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.  ( search ) has inherited large liabilities in recent years and a change in funding rules is needed, said Council President James Klein. \"But it is equally true that the financial assumptions used by the agency make the situation appear far worse than it actually is,\" Klein said. In response, the PBGC provided a statement by its auditors,  PricewaterhouseCoopers  ( search ), that the agency's assessment of its financial position was fair and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Council report concluded that the interest rate used to calculate pension obligations, now less than 5 percent, is too low, and that the PBGC shortfall would be only $14.3 billion if a 6.2 percent corporate bond rate were adopted. It added that the PBGC does not have a current solvency crisis and \"by any reasonable measure, the PBGC has sufficient assets to continue paying benefits for at least 15-20 years.\" The report was in sharp contrast to a Congressional Budget Office report last week that predicted a jump in PBGC liabilities to $87 billion over the next decade and $142 billion in 20 years. The CBO factored in estimates of future bankruptcies and plan terminations, predictions that gained some reality last week when Delta and Northwest, two major pension plan holders, filed for bankruptcy. The PBGC, founded in 1974, guarantees payments of basic pension benefits for about 44 million workers and retirees in more than 31,000 private-sector plans. It operates on revenues from premiums and investments, but there's growing concern that without reform it will require a taxpayer bailout. The agency went from a surplus just four years ago to a mounting deficit as it took over the pension obligations of bankrupt steel and airline companies. Congress has made pension reform a top priority, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the Senate could take up the issue after it votes on John Robert's nomination to be chief justice. Grassley and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., have a bill that would use a bond yield curve to calculate pension funding, set a timetable for underfunded plans to catch up, establish new transparency and disclosure rules, and increase annual premiums paid to the PBGC from $19 to $30 per worker. Grassley's committee is seeking to find common ground with a competing bill by Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wy. At issue is how to strike a balance between the need to shore up PBGC finances and force faltering funds to meet their obligations without putting an undue financial burden on the majority of plans that are well run. The number of defined benefit plans fell from 114,000 in 1985 to 31,000 in 2004 as many smaller companies dropped their plans. The ABC report warned that overstating the risks to the system could undermine confidence and lead to further plan terminations and freezes.", "date": "2015-03-25"},
{"description": "President Bush signed into law a bill that will help protect earned income tax credits of Gulf Coast workers.", "author": "| Associated Press", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/story/bush-signs-bill-to-help-gulf-coast-tax-credits", "title": "Bush Signs Bill to Help Gulf Coast Tax Credits", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013  Mississippi and Louisiana lead in the nation in the portion of families who rely on a tax credit for the working poor, the kind of help that can be disrupted by job losses and family separations like those caused by  Hurricane Katrina  ( search ). President Bush on Friday signed into law new rules that protect those  Gulf Coast  ( search ) workers from seeing their earned income tax credits shrink. The benefit, designed as an incentive for work, can mean refunds up to $4,400 for some workers with children. Alan Berube  ( search ), an expert in low-income issues at the Brookings Institution, said the credit is one of the most significant things the federal government does for New Orleans, in particular. \"This year,\" Berube said, \"it's going to mean that much more because it's going to make up some of this gap in employment and wages.\" Here, in question-and-answer form, are more details about the new law and some potential problems workers should keep in mind: Q: What is the problem? A: The credit calculation depends on two factors, income earned from work and children. Some people who lost their jobs after the hurricane would have smaller tax credits because they won't earn as much this year. Children who live in more than one household during the year might not have lived six months in one place, a requirement to claim the credit, before the hurricane struck and some families separated. Q: How does the law fix the problem? A: The law says workers can choose between using income earned last year or income earned this year for the purposes of calculating the earned income tax credit. The change lets workers maximize their credit, despite prolonged unemployment after the hurricane. Q: Which year's income should I use? A: That depends. At very low wages, more income means a bigger credit, but once a worker makes more than about $15,000, the credit shrinks as income goes up, said John Wancheck, the earned income credit campaign coordinator at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That means workers should try the calculation both ways and find out which yields a bigger credit. Q: What about my children? A: The new rules do not specifically change the requirement that your child live with you for six months or more this year. However, lawmakers gave the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service the authority to make sure taxpayers in the Gulf Coast do not lose their credits, deductions or household status because of temporary dislocations caused by the storm. Q: How do I find out how much money I made this year? A: Employers send that information to employees and the IRS after the end of the year. Q: What if my employer went out of business? A: If your employer went out of business and all of its records are destroyed, it might be up to you to piece together your income. Kathy Burlison, director of tax implementation at H&R Block, suggests you start with bank statements, checkbook registers or paycheck stubs. If your financial records were destroyed, or you cash paychecks instead of depositing them into an account, Burlison recommends sitting down with a calendar to piece together, week by week, the number of hours worked and the amount in your paycheck. Q: Do these rules apply to Hurricane Rita? A: No, the rules are specific to those hit by Hurricane Katrina.", "date": "2015-03-25"},

Watch   \"The O'Reilly Factor\"   weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET and listen to the   \"Radio Factor!\" BILL O'REILLY, HOST:  Thank you for staying with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly. In the \"Factor Follow-up\" segment tonight, while most politicians have stayed far away from Cindy Sheehan because of her somewhat radical views, a few showbiz people have embraced her. In the past, Ms. Sheehan has criticized Israel, saying it is occupying Palestine, has called Iraqi insurgents freedom fighters, has accused Americans of killing people ever since we stepped on this continent, has threatened Hillary Clinton with the loss of her job unless she calls for a pull-out of U.S. troops from Iraq and has called the U.S. action against Afghanistan a failure. Quite a resume. And with us now is Phil Donahue, who supports Ms. Sheehan's dissent. So I'm assuming you don't \u2014 you don't support all her positions that I just ran down. PHIL DONAHUE, FORMER TALK SHOW HOST:  Let's understand what's happening here. Once again we have a woman who got to be just a little too famous for the people who support this war. A minority of the American population, by the way. And so the effort to marginalize this woman is underway. And you're helping out. O'REILLY:  I'm \u2014 I'm the leader of the pack. DONAHUE:  You're suggesting... O'REILLY:  I'm the leader of the pack. DONAHUE:  First of all, Cindy Sheehan is one tough mother. And nothing you say or anyone else is going to slow her down. O'REILLY:  No, that's fine. She has a right to do that. DONAHUE:  You can't hurt her. She's already taken the biggest punch in the nose that a woman can take. She's lost a son. O'REILLY:  OK. DONAHUE:  She's lost a child. O'REILLY:  But look, I'm not putting words in her mouth. DONAHUE:  And by the way, she is going to be at the center of one of the largest rallies since the Vietnam War: proud, patriotic Americans who will show up in Washington this week for one of the most massive, largest demonstrations, protest demonstrations... O'REILLY:  And we'll cover it. DONAHUE:  ... right outside the president's window. O'REILLY:  And we'll cover it. DONAHUE:  And FOX is in the business of saying that this woman is somehow saying un-American things. Hyperbole. O'REILLY:  No, no, no, no. DONAHUE:  Listen to what she's saying. O'REILLY:  Nobody said she said anything un-American. We say that her positions are radical. And they are radical. DONAHUE:  Let me tell you what's radical. What's radical is to send more Americans to die in this war, which is a monumental blunder... O'REILLY:  All right. DONAHUE:  ... by a president who swaggered us into it with, by the way, the at least tacit approval of the Democratic Party. There's a lot of sin to go around here. O'REILLY:  What's radical... DONAHUE:  You want to send more people to this war? Is that your position? O'REILLY:  If we cut and run out of there like you want to do, we would be putting every American in a thousand times more jeopardy than they're in now. DONAHUE:  We're going to cut and run anyway, Bill. O'REILLY:  Well, that's your opinion. DONAHUE:  It's not my opinion. American military leaders have said we're going to draw down, beginning next year. The reason they said that... O'REILLY:  There's a difference between drawing down and cutting and running. DONAHUE:  Well... O'REILLY:  You're a cut and run guy, and I don't want my family in danger because of you. DONAHUE:  You want to stay the course, don't you? You don't... O'REILLY:  Look, here's what I want to do. I want to give the Iraqis a chance to train their army so they can defeat these people who are trying to turn it into a terrorist state. DONAHUE:  Bill... O'REILLY:  That's what I want to do. DONAHUE:  Bill... O'REILLY:  Go. DONAHUE:  Iraq was not a terrorist state. O'REILLY:  Oh, no. (CROSSTALK) DONAHUE:  I hope I don't patronize you for thinking that. O'REILLY:  He was a swell guy. He was... DONAHUE:  Saddam \u2014 Saddam was a bastard. But he was our bastard. O'REILLY:  He wasn't anybody's... DONAHUE:  Donald Rumsfeld shook his hand in the '80s. O'REILLY:  Well, that's true (ph). DONAHUE:  You saw the pictures. Now listen. Listen. You wouldn't send your children to this war, Bill. O'REILLY:  My nephew just enlisted in the Army. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. DONAHUE:  Very good. Very good. Congratulations. Be proud. O'REILLY:  Yes, and he's a patriot, so don't denigrate his service or I'll boot you right off the set. DONAHUE:  I'm not \u2014 I'm not... O'REILLY:  That boy made a decision to serve his country. Do not denigrate him or you're out of here. DONAHUE:  I'm not Jeremy Glick, Billy. You can't intimidate me. O'REILLY:  That's right. A little bit more intelligent than he is. DONAHUE:  I'm not somebody you can come and just do all your... O'REILLY:  Don't tell me I wouldn't send my kids. DONAHUE:  Loud doesn't mean right. O'REILLY:  My nephew just enlisted. You don't know what you're talking about. DONAHUE:  All right. You \u2014 your nephew is not your kid. You are... O'REILLY:  He's my blood. DONAHUE:  You are part of a loud group of people who want to prove they're tough and send other people's kids to war to make the case. O'REILLY:  You have no clue about how to fight a war on terror or how to defend your country. You are clueless. So is Ms. Sheehan. For Ms. Sheehan to say that the insurgents have a right to kill Americans, and you're shaking her hand? You ought to just walk away. DONAHUE:  How many more young men and women are you going to send to have their arms and legs blown off... O'REILLY:  This is a war on terror. DONAHUE:  ... so that you can be tough and point at people in a kind of cowardly way... O'REILLY:  No. DONAHUE:  ... take people like Jeremy Glick, who comes on to, in memory of his parents... O'REILLY:  Oh, bull. DONAHUE:  ... and you go off on him... O'REILLY:  Jeremy Glick is... DONAHUE:  ... like a big bully. Do you feel that you have to be \u2014 you have to feel sorry about that. O'REILLY:  Mr. Donahue, with all due respect... DONAHUE:  Have you apologized to him for that? O'REILLY:  Baloney. Jeremy Glick came on this program... DONAHUE:  You know what I'm talking about? O'REILLY:  ... and accused the president of the United States... DONAHUE:  Oh, and you had... O'REILLY:  ... of orchestrating 9/11. That's what he did, right after 9/11 happened. Do you know what the pain that brought the families who lost people in 9/11? DONAHUE:  This war... O'REILLY:  You buy into left-wing propaganda... DONAHUE:  This war... O'REILLY:  ... and you're a mouthpiece for it. Go ahead. DONAHUE:  This war is not fair to the American troops. This war is unconstitutional. This war turned its back on the people who framed the most fabulous document in the history of civilization. I speak of the United States Constitution. O'REILLY:  Why \u2014 why isn't the Democratic... DONAHUE:  This \u2014 we have \u2014 by the way... O'REILLY:  ... Party speaking that way? DONAHUE:  I'm sorry that it isn't. I am. But let's understand something. O'REILLY:  Are we all \u2014 are we all so misguided? DONAHUE:  Twenty-one \u2014 excuse me. Twenty-one Democrats in the Senate voted against this war, as well as Jeffords, an independent. And may the Lord shine his blessings down upon Lincoln Chaffee... O'REILLY:  All right. I'm going to give you... DONAHUE:  ... the only \u2014 I'm almost finished, Billy. O'REILLY:  I'm going to give you the last word. DONAHUE:  I'm almost finished. O'REILLY:  All right. DONAHUE:  Lincoln Chaffee, the only Republican in the Senate to vote against this war. We should be building statues to all these people. O'REILLY:  All right. DONAHUE:  October 2002, they stood up to a president and they knew that, first of all, only Congress can declare war. Why is that unimportant to you, Billy? O'REILLY:  It's not \u2014 I'm not... DONAHUE:  Why can't you become the patriot that your loud voice proclaims to be? O'REILLY:  A loud voice... DONAHUE:  And stand behind the Constitution and insist that we never go to war again without the approval \u2014 and... O'REILLY:  All right. DONAHUE:  ... the United States Congress. O'REILLY:  If they want to take action, they can take action. Now I want to say something, I'm going to give you the last word. The Iraq war is not something that I embrace. It absolutely could be a tactical error. DONAHUE:  Well, you should... O'REILLY:  All right? DONAHUE:  It's hard to know this, Billy. O'REILLY:  Listen to me and then you're going to have the last word. Not something I embrace, could be a tactical error, optional war and we have not waged it the way I had hoped we would wage it. DONAHUE:  But what? O'REILLY:  But we are in the war on terror. DONAHUE:  You want kids to die (ph). O'REILLY:  We are in the war on terror. Our cause is noble. DONAHUE:  It has nothing to do with the war on terror. O'REILLY:  Yes, it does. And if you don't understand geopolitics and you don't understand Iraq would be a terrorist state if we pulled out of there... DONAHUE:  The mistake... O'REILLY:  ... you don't know anything. DONAHUE:  ... it was poorly planned... O'REILLY:  Go ahead. DONAHUE:  ... poorly executed, but Bill O'Reilly wants to send more kids to fight and die. We've already had almost 2,000. Just let me have the last word. In the last year, two things have doubled. The number of dead American troops in Iraq have doubled, from over 1,000 to almost 2,000. You know what else doubled, Billy? The price of Halliburton's stock. O'REILLY:  All right. DONAHUE:  From $33 to $66. That doesn't shame you? That doesn't make you wonder? O'REILLY:  I'm not obsessed by Halliburton stock. DONAHUE:  If this is an enterprise that is worth the support of the American people? We need you at this rally on Saturday, Billy. O'REILLY:  I don't care. I'm not going to be there.  DONAHUE:  We need you out in front of it to be \u2014 to protest. O'REILLY:  Not going to be at the rally. DONAHUE:  There is no democracy without dissent. O'REILLY:  Not going to protest. DONAHUE:  You should be proud of people who stand up and dissent. O'REILLY:  I am. I respect your... DONAHUE:  A lot of fine men went and died to give me that freedom. O'REILLY:  All right. You got it. You got it. I respect your dissent. I think you're way off in your analysis of the war on terror. DONAHUE:  You want to send more people to die in Iraq? Is that \u2014 is that your position? O'REILLY:  I want to win the war in Iraq. DONAHUE:  Win. What does win mean? Tell me what win means.  O'REILLY:  It means those people have a chance at democracy. I've got to go. DONAHUE:  How long is that going to take? O'REILLY:  Got to go. DONAHUE:  How long is that going to take? O'REILLY:  Those people deserve a chance at freedom. Thank you for coming in. Content and Programming Copyright 2005 Fox News Network, L.L.C. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Nuke Referral", "content": "VIENNA, Austria \u2013  The  European Union  ( search ) submitted a motion on Friday that sets Iran up for referral to the  U.N. Security Council  ( search ), and pushed for a decision Saturday when the 35-nation board of the International Atomic Energy Agency reconvenes. Iran increased its own pressure against referral, threatening to restart uranium enrichment \u2014 a possible pathway to nuclear arms, diplomats accredited to the agency told The Associated Press. They said Iran also warned it could block access for inspectors for the  International Atomic Energy Agency  ( search ) it had agreed to under a document that Iran has not yet ratified. The diplomats \u2014 who demanded anonymity because their information was confidential \u2014 said both threats were contained in unsigned letters and shown by a member of the Iranian delegation to the IAEA head,  Mohamed Elbaradei  ( search ). If signed and submitted, the letters become part of the official record. The EU motion \u2014 a draft resolution to the IAEA's board of governors \u2014 calls on the 35-nation board to consider reporting Iran to the council. As grounds, it mentions noncompliance with provisions of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and suspicions that Iran's nuclear activities could threaten international peace and security, according to a draft copy obtained by the AP. Any resolution still must be accepted by the board before it has validity. The board agreed to reconvene Saturday and the Europeans, backed by the Americans and their allies, were expected to call then for approval by consensus or, if that proved impossible, for a vote. The board normally makes decisions by consensus, but the divisive nature of the draft was expected to result in a vote, which the Europeans were expected to win against Iran's allies at the IAEA. The Security Council could impose sanctions if it determines that Iran violated the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but veto-carrying council members Russia and China \u2014 which oppose even referral to the council \u2014 were certain to vote against such action, and the draft made no mention of sanctions. Still, it was unequivocal in saying that \u2014 unless Iran ends uranium conversion and clears up questions remaining about its past nuclear activities \u2014 the grounds exist for Security Council referral. A nation's failure to comply with the nonproliferation treaty is automatic grounds for a report to the Security Council under IAEA statutes, and the draft said \"Iran's many failures and breaches of its obligations ... constitute noncompliance.\" Additionally, Iran's spotty record on cooperating with an IAEA probe since that began in 2002 has resulted in an \"absence of confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes,\" the document said. That finding puts Iran \"within the competence of the Security Council, as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security,\" the text said. The draft did not specify a time frame for referral, but outlined what Iran must do to avoid being brought before the Security Council, including: \u2022 Giving IAEA experts \"access to individuals, documentation relating to (nuclear) procurement, dual use equipment, certain military owned workshops and research and development locations\" \u2022 A return to \"full and sustained suspension of all enrichment-related activity ... and reprocessing activity\" \u2014 allusions to the resumption by Iran last month of uranium conversion \u2014 a precursor of enrichment, which can result in either nuclear fuel or the fissile core of warheads \u2022 Iran's ratification of the additional agreement with the IAEA giving its inspectors the right to look more closely at Iran's nuclear activities. From the tone of the draft submitted, it appeared the European Union decided to go with a harsher text, even at the risk of alienating Russia. The Europeans for years avoided U.S. demands for support in its push to haul Iran before the Security Council. They reluctantly swung behind Washington last month, after Tehran effectively walked away from talks with Britain, France and Germany meant to reduce suspicions about its nuclear aims and began uranium conversion.", "date": "2015-03-25"},

SEAN HANNITY, CO-HOST:  The coastal city of  Galveston, Texas  ( search ) is a ghost town tonight as residents obey the mandatory order to evacuate as soon as possible. We're joined by a native of Galveston, Texas,  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison , is with us. Senator, I want to reiterate and go back to the issue of evacuation. We're looking at the scene live, now. And we are getting reports, now, all night that it's taking people literally just move a few miles hours and hours. Are you confident everybody's going to have enough time still to get out and how long do you expect if somebody wanted to leave Galveston it would take them to get to place where they can secure themselves? HUTCHINSON:  Well, it has been taking 16 to 18 hours for trips that are usually three or four. That is not a good sign. But the good news is we have 24 more hours and that should be enough time, if they open those freeways, to allow people to get out. It should not be this clogged for this long. There's no question. But there are 24 hours left, we're still ahead of where we were at the Katrina evacuation and we hope that we can clear those (UNINTELLIGIBLE) by tomorrow night. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY:  Senator, I want to go back to the question I was asking you in the last segment because we see these cars that had to pull over, many of them lost gas. You said the mayor and others are working on that. How soon can you get gas to those people that need it to continue their trips? Because I'm told by people, all day, that there is hardly a gas station in town that has anything. HUTCHINSON:  That is what I've heard, too. That was the big complaint that mayors have. And I know that they were trying to get gas portable into tanks. And I hope that that is happening right now. COLMES:  Senator, I'm just concerned that some of these pictures may discourage people from evacuating. We don't want that to happen. People are better off getting in their cars and getting out of town, aren't they? Even if they have to sit for a while? Than staying where they are. HUTCHINSON:  That is true. I think that the worst thing would be for people right on that coastline, particularly the low-lying areas that are prone to flooding, they really need to get out. We should have learned that lesson from  Katrina  ( search ). This is still a Category 4 storm. And I just hope that people will, maybe watch the traffic and maybe wait a little while, so that maybe it starts clearing, but staying if you're in a low-lying area would be very dangerous. HANNITY:  All right, Senator Hutchison. We send you all our best on all the people of Texas and wish everybody a safe evacuation here. Thank you for being with us tonight, Senator.

The Orioles said Major League Baseball absolved Tejada of any wrongdoing. \"They tested the stuff Miggy had and found out it was B12 and cleared it and that's the end of the story,\" Orioles executive vice president  Jim Beattie  ( search ) said. Palmeiro said he received vitamin B-12 from Tejada, a person familiar with Palmeiro's unsuccessful grievance hearing to overturn the suspension said Thursday on condition of anonymity because the proceedings were secret. Tejada dismissed Palmeiro's assertion as implausible. \"Right now I'm in shock,\" Tejada, a former American League MVP, said after Baltimore lost to the  New York Yankees  ( search ) on Thursday night. \"I've never given anybody steroids before,\" he said. \"I've been checked out three times already, and I'm clean. I've been clean all my life.\" Tejada said he gave Palmeiro the B-12 injection \"a long time ago.\" \"It doesn't bother me because I'm not guilty. I've done nothing wrong. I just gave him B-12, and B-12 is legal,\" Tejada said. \"You don't get caught for B-12.\" Vitamin B-12 helps maintain healthy nerve cells and red blood cells, and is commonly found in foods such as fish, meat, poultry and dairy products. Palmeiro has not publicly discussed details of the testimony he gave during a grievance filed by the players' association to overturn his 10-day suspension, which followed a positive test for stanozolol. He testified before the House Government Reform Committee last March that he never used steroids and was interviewed by congressional investigators following the Aug. 1 announcement on his penalty. His lawyers, Mayer, Brown, Rowe and Maw LLP, issued a statement Thursday night saying they \"are disturbed about the misleading reports being leaked by unnamed sources who claim knowledge of the investigation.\" \"Rafael Palmeiro has never implicated any player in the intentional use or distribution of steroids, or any other illegal substance, in any interview or testimony,\" the statement said. According to the person familiar with the investigation, Palmeiro listed the B-12 as a possible reason for the positive test but did not make any definitive accusation. Before Thursday's 7-6 loss, Orioles interim manager Sam Perlozzo was asked about Thursday's report in The (Baltimore) Sun that the first baseman had named a teammate in trying to explain his steroid test. \"If in fact that was true, then it probably would not be a good idea\" for Palmeiro to return, Perlozzo said. \"It's all speculation as far as I know.\" Palmeiro went 2-for-26 with one RBI after his return from the suspension, and was sent home by Baltimore on Sept. 5 for rehabilitation on his right knee and left ankle. \"I know that he still would like to come back,\" Perlozzo said. \"He doesn't want to be a distraction and all that. I pretty much told him that as far as I was concerned, it was an organizational decision.\" Beattie said no decision would be made until Friday at the earliest. \"We're talking to Raffy right now about that,\" Beattie said in a telephone interview, saying he didn't want to \"comment on hearsay.\" Perlozzo didn't discuss with Palmeiro what he may or may not have told the panel. \"I did not ask him,\" he said. \"I didn't think that was my job.\" Palmeiro's situation is complicated, so Perlozzo wanted the front office to make the decision. \"A lot of things factor in,\" he said. \"Is he going to play or is he not going to play? How much is he going to play? And is it worthwhile to take that chance?\" Arn Tellem, Palmeiro's agent, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. House Government Reform Committee spokesman Dave Marin declined comment. Baseball has not said when the positive test occurred. Palmeiro, who turns 41 on Saturday, is batting .266 with 18 homers and 60 RBIs. He got his 3,000th hit on July 15, joining Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Eddie Murray as the only players with 3,000 hits and 500 homers.

Saudi Arabia's foreign minister,  Prince Saud al-Faisal  ( search ), told The Associated Press on Thursday that the Bush administration did not heed some Saudi warnings on occupying Iraq and that he didn't believe a new constitution and elections would solve Iraq's problems. \"Perhaps what they are saying is going to happen,\" Saud said. \"I wish it would happen, but I don't think that a constitution by itself will resolve the issues, or an election by itself will solve the difficult problems.\" Saud cautioned that U.S. policies in Iraq risk dividing the country into three separate parts: Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite. \"We have not seen a move inside Iraq that would satisfy us that the national unity of Iraq, and therefore the territorial unity of Iraq, will be assured,\" he said. Saud also said that the Saudis were skeptical of the outcome before the United States went to war in Iraq and that their concerns weren't always heeded. \"It is frustrating to see something that is clearly going to happen and you are not listened to by a friend and soon harm comes out of it,\" he said. \"It hurts.\" The foreign minister said his kingdom was not ready to send an ambassador to Baghdad because the diplomat would become an immediate target for assassination. \"I doubt that he'd last a day,\" Saud said. On Friday the State Department responded with a far-brighter forecast. \"We see a situation in Iraq in which the Iraqi people at every opportunity have chosen to pull together in the political process,\" McCormack said. Apart from terrorists and insurgents, \"the vast majority of Iraqis at every point ... pull together and come together,\" he said. By way of example, McCormack said more than 1 million Sunnis registered to vote. \"More and more Iraqis want to participate in the political process,\" he said. \"We fully support a unified Iraq, an Iraq that is free, an Iraq that is stable and peaceful,\" the spokesman said. \"And that is what we are working with the Iraqi government to try to achieve.\"", "date": "2015-03-25"},
{"description": "An anonymous Cardinal broke his vow of silence and published a diary with details of the papal conclave that elected present pope Joseph Ratzinger.", "author": "| Associated Press", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/story/cardinal-spills-secrets-from-conclave", "title": "Cardinal Spills Secrets from Conclave", "content": "ROME \u2013  A cardinal has broken his vow of secrecy and released his diary describing the conclave that elected  Pope Benedict XVI  ( search ), revealing in an exceedingly rare account that a cardinal from Argentina was the main challenger and almost blocked Benedict's election. Excerpts of the diary, published Friday, show Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger led in each of the four ballots cast in the Sistine Chapel during the mystery-shrouded April 18-19 conclave. But, in a surprise,  Cardinal Jorge Maria Bergoglio  ( search ), a Jesuit, was in second place the whole time. Most accounts of the conclave have said retired Milan archbishop  Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini  ( search ) was the main challenger to Ratzinger, who became Benedict XVI after his election, and that a Third World pope was never realistically in the running. While Bergoglio never threatened Ratzinger's lead -- and made clear he didn't want the job, according to the diary published in the respected Italian foreign affairs magazine Limes -- his runner-up status could signal the next conclave might elect a pope from Latin America, home to half the world's 1 billion Roman Catholics. The diary of the anonymous cardinal is also significant because it shows that Ratzinger didn't garner a huge margin -- he had 84 of the 115 votes in the final ballot, seven more than the required two-thirds majority. His two immediate predecessors, Pope John Paul II and Pope John Paul I, are believed to have garnered 99 and 98 votes respectively, and that was when there were only 111 voting cardinals. \"It does seem that somebody wants to indicate that the conclave was a more complex process than was being depicted and that Benedict's mandate was not a slam dunk,\" said David Gibson, a former Vatican Radio journalist who is writing a biography of Benedict. Finally, the diary includes a few surprises, including a vote in the final ballot for Cardinal Bernard Law, forced to resign as Boston archbishop because of the church sex abuse scandal. And it offers other colorful insights of what went on behind the scenes during the two days the 115 red-hatted princes of the church were sequestered in the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel to select the 265th leader of the Catholic Church. Because the hotel prohibits smoking, Portuguese Cardinal Jose Policarpo da Crux would sneak outside for an after-dinner cigar, the diary says. And Cardinal Walter Kasper shunned the minibuses that shuttled cardinals to the Sistine Chapel, preferring to walk by the Vatican gardens instead. \"Sunday, April 17: In the afternoon I took over my room at the Casa Santa Marta. I put down my bags and tried to open the blinds because the room was dark. I wasn't able to. One of my fellow brothers asked a nun working there, thinking it was a technical problem. She explained they were sealed. Closure of the conclave...\" the diary begins. The published diary entries were interspersed with commentary from Vatican journalist Lucio Brunelli, who says he obtained the diary through a trusted source he had known for years. He told The Associated Press he spoke in Italian to his source -- a hint the cardinal in question was Italian. Brunelli says he couldn't identify the author because of the vow of secrecy each cardinal took before entering the conclave. Punishment for violating the vow is excommunication. In Buenos Aires, a spokesman for the archdiocese, Enzo Paoletta, said Bergoglio had no comment on the report. Nothing official is ever recorded from conclaves and the ballots are burned in the Sistine Chapel stove -- ashes that signal to the world through white smoke or black whether a pope has been elected. As a result, the diary's tallies -- which Brunelli said he confirmed through other cardinals -- are unusual, although previously tallies have leaked out piecemeal. According to the diary, Ratzinger won 47 votes and Bergoglio 10 on the first round of balloting, while Martini got nine and some 30 others got a few votes. In round two, Ratzinger edged up to 65 and Bergoglio 35. By the third ballot, Ratzinger had 72 votes, just five shy of the two-thirds majority needed to win. But Bergoglio got 40, just over the threshold needed to stall the conclave if his supporters wanted to. However, the diary says Bergoglio made it clear he might not have accepted the job. The cardinal recalls watching Bergoglio cast his ballot: \"The suffering face, as if he were begging: 'God don't do this to me.\"' Marco Politi, Vatican correspondent for La Repubblica, said if the diary showed anything, it's that outsiders really have no idea what happens during a conclave, since so many of the media's preconceived ideas were proved wrong. \"To know more, we have to wait for other tears in the secret,\" he wrote Friday. Gibson speculated the diary's author was Italian and wanted to set the record straight that Ratzinger, a German, didn't have as significant a margin as some had suggested. \"Outside of Italy, Catholics and churchmen have a very kind of mystical view of the Vatican and especially the conclave,\" Gibson said. \"The Italians have always had a more kind of political view of the process ... for them it's their election, and they're much more comfortable with it, as a human as well as a divine process.\"", "date": "2015-03-25"},

Laura Linney  (  search ) and  Jeff Daniels  (  search ) play the parents in \u201cSquid.\u201d Linney\u2019s role is much different from her last outing in \u201cThe Exorcism of Emily Rose.\u201d I asked her about a recent New York Times article suggesting that Hollywood films are taking a conservative bent post-\u201cPassion of the Christ,\u201d citing the religiously themed \u201cEmily Rose\u201d as an example. \u201cI think the article is pushing it a little far,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you can use any horror film and apply that argument. But I need to formulate my thoughts a little further.\u201d OK, we\u2019ll get back to her at the next premiere\u2026. Daniels\u2019 academic dad reminded me of his early role as Debra Winger\u2019s deadbeat hubby, Flap Horton, in \u201cTerms of Endearment.\u201d \u201cI can see in some ways how this can be Flap Horton, who is grown up as only Flap could,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the script is unique to Noah and what he went through. I didn\u2019t have a clue how I was gonna pull this off, so there is this tremendous risk for failure.\u201d What?! The man\u2019s made, like, 40 films, and he still thinks he's gonna screw things up royally? I wondered if he kept his old movies around the house for the occasional critique. \u201cWe have DVDs of pretty much everything I have done,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they\u2019re basically for when I am dead so the kids can watch them and see dad. They\u2019ll be playing at my wake.\u201d Daniels was quite funny and sweet - I\u2019m crowning him favorite actor of the week. God, I\u2019m easy. One more tidbit: When you see the film -- and you should when it opens next week -- you\u2019ll wonder who gives the breakout performance as the family\u2019s younger brother. It\u2019s 14-year-old  Owen Kline  (  search ), son of Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates. Owen was there with his proud folks. Come to think of it, this film about divorce was packed with (relatively) long-lasting Hollywood couples. Hope I didn\u2019t just jinx them. Empty 'Bubble' You may have heard buzz about a documentary called  \"Inside the Bubble,\"  (  search ) which, according to the film\u2019s press release, reveals the \u201cDemocrats' worst fears about the Kerry Campaign -- a disorganized, contensious [sic], self-aborbed [sic] team that thought that they could win by \u2018not making mistakes\u2019 and keeping their candidate in the public eye without every clarifiying [sic] a position on anything.\u201d Other than needing a better spell-check device, the writer of this release needs a serious clue. I\u2019ve seen the film, which is yet to find a distributor, and it\u2019s hardly what the release purports it to be. It mainly features the press wranglers and personal aides who traveled with Kerry during the last leg of the campaign -- some of them cursing at a bad photo op or moaning about lack of sleep. Halfway through, it plays like a home movie (calls home to the kids, celebrating colleagues\u2019 birthdays), and by the end it\u2019s like watching paint dry. How exciting is it to see someone check his Blackberry? I\u2019ve met producer Doug Davis, who\u2019s a very nice guy. He was behind the camera, in the trenches with these folks for months; Steve Rosenbaum is the film\u2019s director. The project grew out of a TV series the two did called \u201cStaffers,\u201d which aired on the Discovery Times channel. \"Staffers\" followed the campaigns of all Democratic hopefuls during the primary. I didn\u2019t see \u201cStaffers,\u201d and had trouble finding reviews. The one I did find, in the Los Angeles Times, said \u201cviewers never quite learn why these people are willing to abuse themselves in the name of the electorate.\u201d The same can be said for \u201cBubble\u201d -- but there\u2019s a deeper problem. There are too few moments with the campaign\u2019s heavier hitters, such as Mike McCurry and Joe Lockhart (in fact, Lockhart\u2019s mug barely appears). Where\u2019s the real strategizing? Or the campaign\u2019s \u201cself-absorbed,\u201d \u201ccontentious\u201d team?\u201d Still, the press release presses on: \u201c\u2026 the rare moments of authentic engagement, the Candidate's struggle to connect, and the Democrats' desperate wish to imbue John Kerry with a complex muddle of political perspectives\u2026 creates a campaign that struggles to say anything that reaches the other side.\u201d That may have been true of the campaign, but all I saw on screen is a movie that struggles to say anything.", "date": "2015-03-25"},

Who is your favorite FOX News on-air person and why? (If by some wild chance I am your favorite, don't send that in an e-mail since I won't post it...) 4.  Is  obesity  a national health problem?

Are you happy that another holiday is approaching? Or do you dread it? (and why?) I have received many e-mails from viewers about criminal investigations we have covered in the past and are not currently covering. The viewers want to know why we are not currently reporting them. There is a reason: There is no news in the investigations. We do however \u2014 behind the scenes \u2014 make daily calls to all our sources to see if there is an update. As soon as there is news on the investigations, we will tell you. By the way, have you checked out the  \"On the Record\" hats and mugs  we sell on the FOX News Web site? Just so you know, I do not get a \"cut\" of the sales, but I am flattered when I hear people go online and get them. I like to know viewers feel connected to the show enough to want mugs and hats. Now for some e-mails: E-mail No. 1 Hi,  Are you aware of the broadcast of famous Dutch crime reporter Peter R. de Vries yesterday, about the Holloway-case? It seems like the local Aruban authorities did frustrate the investigation up to the point, where the detectives were NOT allowed to search the house of the van der Sloots. They did search the small detached house where Joran lived, but they never searched the house of his father.  Isn't it likely that the body of Natalee Holloway could be found, for example, under the floor of this house? No authorities in Aruba were ever allowed to do a forensic investigation there.  I think it's worth watching the Peter R de Vries broadcast, it sheds whole new light on the Aruban investigation and the strange role Dutch magistrates (personal friends of Mr. van der Sloot) played in it.  My guess is Natalee's body can be found in the house of Joran's parents, the only place in Aruba nobody ever took a closer look at, or were prevented from doing so. Cliff Cremer  Amsterdam  P.S. Did you also know that Joran van der Sloot paid somebody to make a fake photo of him with Natalee? E-mail No. 2 Hi Greta,  I hope you had a great and restful Thanksgiving. I really enjoy the crime scene specials that you do. Please do more of them. About 10 years ago I lost 2 forty-year-old coworkers (husband and wife) in Lake Michigan. They were boating with friends to Michigan to celebrate their 21st wedding anniv. They never made it. They found the body of the wife but never found the man. A lie detector test was done on the friends and they said the man died in their arms. A big swell came up and went over the boat and broke it up. After this I checked something out. There are a lot of people missing in Lake Michigan!  I don't think any of these people will ever be found! Bye from Wisconsin Libby  P.S. Will you let us know what happens to that man in Reno who killed his wife with an injection of succs? And will you let us know if he also killed the husband of his future wife the same way? Thanks-love the show Elizabeth Cape E-mail No. 3 I am in shock and utter disbelief at the entire situation. I am foremost disappointed in the behavior of Michael Richards, however, to use his behavior for monetary gain is nothing short of extortion. How is money going to undo or diffuse the situation? I suggest that the if money is sought it should be used to benefit ALL who were offended. Not merely those in the room. If in fact money is being sought due to the racial nature of Richard's rantings then perhaps the money should go to organizations whose mission it is to stamp out racism and prejudice. Personally I wonder who is the racist, Richard's for his words or the two men trying to get rich off his words. Either way racism is at work. S.

The results also suggest that use of combination estrogen plus progestin hormone therapy among older women who smoke could as much as double their risk of developing cancer. Researchers say the results add to growing evidence that breast cancer may be yet another health risk associated with cigarette smoking. \"We know that smoking is associated with a lot of diseases, from lung cancer to heart disease, but the association with breast cancer is still somewhat controversial,\" says researcher Christopher I. Li, MD, PhD, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, in a news release. \"Certainly, the association between smoking and breast cancer is nowhere near as strong as the association between smoking and lung cancer, but breast cancer may be another disease to add to the long list of serious health issues related to smoking.\" Smoking May Raise Breast Cancer Risk Researchers say the study is the first study to look at the link between smoking and breast cancer in nearly 2,000 postmenopausal women between the ages of 65 and 79. Women of this age range may have smoked for very long durations, they write. Risk factors relating to breast cancer vary with age. Because a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk increases with age, the causes of breast cancer in older women may be different from younger women, they add. \u201cThose who did smoke had much longer histories of smoking than women in previous studies, so we were able to look at the effects of long smoking durations on breast cancer risk,\" says Li. The results showed a 30 to 40 percent increased risk of breast cancer among: --Women who were current or long-term smokers (a pack a day for 11 years or more) --Women who started smoking at a younger age --Women who started smoking before the birth of their first child The study also showed that women who had smoked cigarettes for 20 years or more and used combination hormone replacement therapy were more than twice as likely to develop breast cancer as women who have never smoked or used hormone replacement therapy. \"We are really not sure what that finding means because this correlation hasn't been reported in prior studies,\" says Li. \"We only saw the association in smokers who used both estrogen and progestin and not among women who used estrogen alone. We will follow up on this finding in future studies to see if it can be replicated.\" Never Too Late to Quit Smoking Because the study involved older women, researchers say they were also able to look at the impact of quitting smoking on long-term breast cancer risk. The results showed that the risk of breast cancer decreased as the number of years since the women quit smoking increased. For example, researchers say that within about 10 years after a woman stops smoking her risk of breast cancer falls back to the level of a woman who has never smoked.

Tests by the Interior Department's Office of the Inspector General found several bureaus and offices \"still suffer from serious weaknesses in their security posture,\"  Inspector General Earl Devaney  ( search ) wrote in a Sept. 6 memo to Assistant Secretary Lynn Scarlett. According to the report, obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday, investigators several times were able to masquerade as authorized users, roam the internal networks of some of the department's most sensitive computer systems and manipulate data. The tests were performed in phases beginning in November 2004. But Devaney said the department has balked at fixing the system. \"Rather than simply accepting the results of our testing and promptly addressing the underlying vulnerabilities, the department and bureaus have, to date, expended considerable time and energy debating our findings, challenging our methodology and impugning the credentials and integrity of our staff and contractors,\" Devaney wrote. \"I do not wish to repeat this past experience,\" he added, suggesting the department work to fix the problem. Interior Department spokesman Dan DuBray said the investigation was done as part of an internal effort to identify any \"potential weaknesses or conceivable potential vulnerabilities.\" The department's computer security has been challenged recently as part of a class-action lawsuit in which thousands of American Indians accuse the department of cheating them out of billions of dollars by mismanaging oil, gas, grazing, timber and other royalties from their land since 1887. Plaintiffs have asked that a federal district court judge order  Interior Secretary Gale Norton  ( search ) to shut down the information technology systems to protect data. DuBray said the department will continue to aggressively work to strengthen the computer systems, \"which are now among the most intricately examined in all of government.\"", "date": "2015-03-25"},

But Gibb still knew the best way to express what Streisand was thinking \u2014 especially when it came to the war in Iraq. The result was \" Stranger in a Strange Land  ( search ),\" written by Gibb for Streisand's new album, \"Guilty Pleasures.\" \"I loved the first stanza, because to me this war is kind of senseless, and I don't know why we're there,\" Streisand told The Associated Press. \"Just the sadness of, we're there, but don't want to have those people in harm's way, and yet we do have to support (the troops). It's kind of painful, and I had always imagined just seeing footage of the troops, it's like history repeating itself \u2014 here we are again. That was the meaning to me.\" Streisand and Gibb first worked together on her best-selling 1980 album \"Guilty,\" which contained hits like the title track and \"Woman In Love.\" Streisand calls that album \"really the easiest album I ever made.\" \"Barry is so talented that he can write songs and produce them and make the tracks and sing the background,\" she said. Their new collaboration debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard albums chart, selling more than 101,000 copies. When asked why it took so long to reunite, Streisand had a simple answer: \"Because times flies.\" While the album contains romantic duets and ballads tailor-made for the legend's soaring voice, \"Stranger In a Strange Land\" may be the most compelling track simply because of its subject matter. Though it never mentions Iraq, its message is clear from the opening verse: \"You may be someone else's sweetheart, fighting someone else's war, and if you suffer for the millions, then it's what you're fighting for.\" While few mainstream artists infuse current political events in their music, Streisand wasn't worried about alienating anyone. \"I never think about that, I just think about the song itself,\" she said. \"If I believe in something, than I just say, let it out there.\" Of course, Streisand, a liberal Democrat, has never been one to shy away from politics. She regularly updates her Web site with scathing missives against the Bush administration and articles that underscore her views. Her Web site is one of the few ways Streisand expresses herself in public these days. She rarely speaks to the media, and her artistic endeavors are limited: her appearance in last year's blockbuster comedy \"Meet the Fockers,\" with Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, was the Oscar-winner's first movie since 1996. Making the film did inspire her to relaunch her movie career \u2014 but only to a certain point. \"I'd actually like to direct a movie that I was not in. It was interesting, to go back to the smell of the greasepaint, the roar of the crowd,\" she laughs. \"(But) you have to get up early. I'm spoiled, living my free life.\" Not that her time is all that free. She's building a home-away-from home on her estate, a barn with a screening room, gym, and even a doll shop to showcase her antique finds. The project was started more than a year ago, and is only half finished. When she finally completes it, she hopes to turn her attention to a new project \u2014 not in movies or in music, but a book: Her life story. That is, if anyone is interested. \"Sometimes when I think about it \u2014 who wants to relive my life?\" she asks. \"(But) it would be nice to set the record straight about the truth. I'm an advocate of the truth. To me it's so much more powerful and interesting than peop le making up stories about you.\"", "date": "2015-03-25"},
{"description": "Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco appeared before a Senate panel Wednesday morning. Although she's already come out swinging against former FEMA head Michael Brown, she stayed away from the controversy on Wednesday.", "author": "| Fox News", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/story/blanco-focuses-on-economic-recovery", "title": "Blanco Focuses on Economic Recovery", "content": "WASHINGTON  \u2013  Despite pointed accusations on the slow response to Hurricane Katrina leveled against her, Louisiana Gov.  Kathleen Blanco  ( search ) focused instead on economic recovery during a Senate hearing Wednesday. Blanco was joined by other Gulf Coast governors in the Senate Finance Committee hearing as she called for tax relief, incentive packages and other programs to boost the region\u2019s recovery. And Senate panel members made it clear they want to pass a health care relief package facing White House opposition. \"I am here because the proposals you are considering are about creating jobs. And that is what we need \u2026 jobs,\" the governor said during her opening statement. \"We need jobs to bring our people home and restore our economy.\" A day earlier, former FEMA chief  Michael Brown  ( search ) laid much of the blame at the feet of Blanco and New Orleans Mayor  Ray Nagin  ( search ) for the lethargic response by the government in dealing with Katrina. Blanco and Nagin refuted Brown's claims Tuesday. But on Wednesday, given the opportunity to again respond to Brown's scathing statements from a day earlier, Blanco declined. \"Today, I came really to talk about job creation,\" she told Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. Mississippi Gov.  Haley Barbour  ( search ) and Alabama Gov.  Bob Riley  ( search ) also testified via video conference before the committee. Asked by Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., about FEMA's management of hurricane relief, Blanco replied that an independent commission should be formed to investigate, and \"there are lessons to be learned. ... We can all work hard.\" Blanco also outlined a number of initiatives she hoped Congress would support, including billions of dollars for recovery efforts, largely aimed at helping small businesses get back on their feet. Building better homes and neighborhoods is also imperative for a successful recovery of the Crescent City, she said. \"Katrina and Rita brought our economy to its knees,\" Blanco said. While Barbour requested help for industries pummeled by the storm, including logging and oil production sectors, Riley waded briefly into the more controversial waters of federal power expansion but did not mention FEMA or Brown. Although talk has been made of increasing federal powers, for instance, by letting the military take control after a natural disaster, \u201cimmediate response is always going to have to remain within the states,\u201d Riley said. \u201cFederal government brings a lot to the table in a lot of different ways, but the immediate 24- [to] 48-hour response period is going to have to be handled here\u201d by the state, he added. Riley requested the ability to have emergency assets in place in the state before storms instead of after, \u201crather than having to pick up the pieces later.\u201d When it came to health care relief, the governors said they were in favor of the Grassley-Baucus bill under consideration that would waive application restrictions for Medicaid coverage for all displaced Katrina victims and remove state limits for administering benefits. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the finance committee, said a handful of senators have been blocking action on the bill. The Bush administration has objected to language that would extend Medicaid coverage to thousands in the Gulf Coast who otherwise would be uninsured. Administration officials contend the Medicaid extensions are not needed because a newly created fund could be tapped whenever health care providers care for uninsured victims of Katrina between Aug. 24 and Jan. 31, 2006. Sen. Trent Lott said he would do his best to try to move the bill forward. \"We can work with everybody, including the administration, or against them, and I'm prepared to go either way,\" Lott, R-Miss., said. \"But I'm going to look after our people first.\" But the administration has not revealed how much money will be in the fund, and senators questioned both the funding commitment and whether the administration has the authority to establish such a fund. The easygoing hearing on Wednesday followed Tuesday's contentious action on Capitol Hill, in which a combative Brown laid blame \u2014 including against the White House that appointed him \u2014 for the dismal response to Hurricane Katrina. Brown said the  Federal Emergency Management Agency  ( search ) worked well with Mississippi and Alabama in responding to Katrina, but that the leadership in Louisiana posed a problem because it was never clear who was in charge of the Bayou State. \"My biggest mistake was not recognizing by Saturday that Louisiana was dysfunctional.\" Brown said. To that, Blanco defended herself on Tuesday, saying she was not negligent in her oversight of Louisiana's response to Hurricane Katrina as it roared ashore more than one month ago. Brown resigned Sept. 12 after being relieved of his onsite command of FEMA's response effort three days earlier.

ALAN COLMES, CO-HOST:  Our top story tonight is the controversy surrounding radio talk show host Bill Bennett. Yesterday on his radio show, Mr. Bennett \u2014 Dr. Bennett was quoted as saying, \"I do know that it's true that if you wanted to reduce crime, you could, if that were your sole purpose, you cold abort every black baby in this country and your crime rate would go down...that would be an impossible, ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down. So these far-out, these far-reaching, extensive extrapolations are, I think, tricky.\" The comments have drawn criticism today from Senate minority leader  Harry Reid  ( search ) who said he was appalled. Massachusetts  Senator Ted Kennedy  ( search ) who called them racist and from House minority leader  Nancy Pelosi  ( search ) who said they were shameful. Bill Bennett joins us now in an exclusive interview to talk about these comments. Dr. Bennett, we appreciate you coming on tonight. DR. BILL BENNETT, \"MORNING IN AMERICA\" HOST:  Thank you. COLMES:  Might give you an opportune to put them in context and explain. BENNETT:  Sure. Well, the context was a radio show that I was doing yesterday, and the topic was abortion and we were talking about bad arguments in regard to abortion. A caller suggested he was opposed to abortion because he said if there were more babies there would be, eventually, more tax payers and a larger GNP, a smaller deficit. I said you want to be careful with that kind of argument because someone could postulate a situation where child's not likely to be a productive taxpayer. I said, arguments in which you take something that's far out, like the GNP and try to connect it up with abortion are tricky. I said make the case of abortion on the basis of life and protecting life. I said abortion is invoked in another way \u2014 you could make an argument that if you wanted to lower the crime rate, you saw the quote \u2014 you could practice abortion in very large numbers. You could do it in the black community. You could do it in other places. This is, by the way, the subject of a book for economics by a professor at Yale. I said, however, if you were to practice that, widespread abortion in the black community or any other community, it would be ridiculous, impossible, and I appreciate you putting it on the screen, morally reprehensible. So I think morally reprehensible, when that is included in the quote makes it perfectly clear what my position is. A number of the people whom you have cited as condemning me have not made the inclusion of that remark, and so they make it seem, Alan, as if I am supporting such a monstrous idea, which of course I don't. COLMES:  Here's my concern. The root cause of crime, one would debate, it seems to be poverty. And from your remarks, I wonder if people might interpret it as saying the root cause of crime is race. And that debate about is it race is it poverty? What really is the root cause? And race affects people of all races and creeds and I think that's why... BENNETT:  Poverty. Poverty affects people of all races. Let me tell you what bothers me first, because I'm always candid with you. What bothers me is that last night on your radio show, you were all over me, Alan. And, you know, I was really surprised. You know me, you've known me for a long time and the fact that you would give credence to the notion that I would believe such a thing is very disturbing. I've had 1,000 opportunities when people have said to me what about that Alan Colmes, isn't he a jerk or a liberal this \u2014 I've always said he's always a gentleman, he's nice to me. I run a radio show in which we don't yell at people, we don't make fun of them. We have liberals and conservatives and we deal with sensitive and important public policies issues and we do it in a responsible way. But people need to follow the argument and the argument I was making here is entirely plausible. The causes of crime are very complicated. But there is a very big literature, as you know, about single parenthood in crime, about race in crime, and about poverty in crime. And we've been talking about all these things lately in the context of New Orleans and other things. COLMES:  Let me talk to you... BENNETT:  There are real things in the real world, and there are people who believe we should take such monstrous steps. COLMES:  Let me talk about what I said on my radio show. BENNETT:  I do not. COLMES:  Dr. Bennett \u2014 Bill, because you know, I do consider you someone \u2014 we've been good to each other. I like you. I think you respect me. BENNETT:  Yes sir. COLMES : I was really shocked. BENNETT:  Have been. COLMES:  And I played what you said and the whole context of what you said. Frankly, I was just shocked by it. I don't believe you're a racist. I don't think that you believe those things. I was just shocked by what I heard and basically there was a lot of callers calling up and commenting on it after I played your comments. And a lot of other people were shocked that you would have \u2014 in the context you said it \u2014 say the things you said. BENNETT:  Well, you know, to put forward a hypothesis, a morally impossible hypothesis to show why it is morally impossible and reprehensible seems to me is a standard way of talking about public policy and a standard way of teaching. You know, I've taught philosophy for years and one argues in the hypothetical all the time. People have said such outrageous things, Alan, about race \u2014 and this is certainly not unknown to our history \u2014 to the history of Europe, recently. It's not unknown to the history of Islam. And what we have \u2014 you've got to be able to make an argument and say look, you may be thinking you're going to achieve some good end, but you can't use a monstrous means to do it. You know, this is like a Swift's modest proposal for people who remember their literature. You put things up in order to examine them. I put it up, examined it, and said that is ridiculous and impossible no matter who advances that idea. COLMES:  All right, Sean will be with you in the next segment. There are some statistics, you know, that talk about how African-Americans are treated disparagingly in the criminal justice and, you know, we could debate whether or not there really is a greater prejudice against African-Americans and whether they are incarcerated disproportionately. BENNETT:  Yeah. COLMES:  But look we got to take a break and we'll continue with you... BENNETT:  Those are big complicated questions... (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SEAN HANNITY, CO-HOST:  We continue with the host of  \"Morning in America.\"  ( search ) Bill Bennett is back with us. Bill, first of all, I have known for you many, many years. I know your faith, I know your character, I know who you are. You're a former secretary of education, former drug czar. This notion that Bill Bennett as is being alleged by prominent democrats has any racist bone in his body is appalling to me. BENNETT:  Yeah. HANNITY:  And I'm glad to hear you say what you said here. I want you to respond to those democrats that are grandstanding, the same ones that had  Robert Byrd  ( search ), the former Klansman as their leader. The ones that didn't speak out about Congressman Rangle's \"Bull\" Connor remark. BENNETT:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's see, you got Kennedy. I will \u2014 I'll not take instruction from Teddy Kennedy. A young woman likely drowned because of his negligence. I'll take no moral instruction with him. That's much worse than legal gambling what Teddy Kennedy did. He should make no judgments at all about people. He shouldn't be in the Senate. As far as racist and all this other stuff, I'll put my record up with  Howard Dean  ( search ), with Harry Reid. When I was drug czar, you bet, we were working on the issue of black crime, Alan and Sean, because there was a lot of crime in the black community. And you know who most of the victims are? Their black people. Yeah, black violence \u2014 black-on-black violence is very serious. I went to about 120 inner city communities. That's where the senate wanted me to go, that's where the Senate wanted me to go, that's where I wanted to go. We went after public housing and we went after the bad guys. And you know what? We got the bad guys. And drug use went down. And we raised the price and lowered the purity of cocaine. And we arrested four of the most powerful drug dealers in the world. And got a lot of these guys off the street. And I am very proud of that. Because when we went into the inner city black community, the people said to me, Mr. Czar, or Czar, or Mr. Bennett, you get those people off the street and protect us. And we did our best to do it. Before that, when I was secretary of education, I took on what I think is one of the great civil rights issues of our time, which is educational opportunity and educational choice. The stupid ghettoized curriculum we have, the fact that these black kids go to lousy schools and aren't allowed to choose the schools of their choice because they don't have the money and don't have the opportunity. I've been at this for 25 years and I have been called everything in the book, but I will stay at what I do because I believe it. Let me just tell you, when it comes to abortion, my wife's program,  Best Friends  ( search ), has kept more young women from having abortions because they don't get pregnant because they take her good counsel... HANNITY:  Let me... BENNETT:  Than the entire black caucus. She has done more for inner city black girls than the entire black caucus. So I will not bow my head to any of these people. I will not give up the ground of compassion and sympathy. But I'll tell you, we have real issues and we have got to talk about them candidly. And if you don't think there are people who are making draconian proposals about abortion and this and that and the other thing, you know, you don't know the nature... HANNITY:  Let me ask you this. I want to ask you about the nature of debate in this society. BENNETT:  Sure. HANNITY:  I go back to the  Bill Maher  ( search ) issue. I don't like \u2014 I don't even like Bill Maher. We disagree on just about everything. But Bill Maher said one statement and his entire history of support in the military was cast aside and people focused on one thing. I said wait a minute, that's wrong. Here's Bill Bennett, here's  Trent Lott  ( search ). One statement, there's no room to apologize, explain, put into context, revise or extend one's remarks because people want to hop on it. We now see the democrats trying to do right now with you and trying to put you in a position of characterizing you, or categorizing you as something you are not. What does that tell you about debate and free speech in the country today? BENNETT:  It's bad. You know, if you could do an analysis \u2014 it would be interesting to do an analysis. All day I've been reading reports and statements by people about me, Sean, and it's interesting, some use the whole quote and are fair, some don't. And that tells you something. But the problem, I think, on the liberal side, the democratic side is they attitudinize, they condemn but they don't have a program. You know, the president \u2014 I hope the president pays for this program in New Orleans, but he's got a program, and it's some interesting ideas about enterprise zones and school choice, and giving people opportunities, you know, with the loans and the green lining and they ought to be tried. Because these are ideas that might actually help the poor as opposed to maintaining the welfare state, which does not help poor people at all. It's destroyed a lot of families and it has created circumstances in which more poor people and more black people have had to suffer. What's lifted, the economic life and reduced crime in the black community has been hope and opportunity and education and enterprise. HANNITY:  Let me ask you one last question. BENNETT:  And that I think is much more, I have to tell you on this side of the aisle, I want to politicize this because there are good people on both sides. HANNITY:  Explain. I want you to explain, though, for people that see that one quote, that read that one quote, what do you say to them? BENNETT:  What I say to them, Sean, is if they were given the impression that I, you know, am in favor of such a horrible idea as, you know, my critics are suggesting, they need to look at the whole quote. I don't believe that. And I'm sorry that people have misrepresented my views so much that that has given folks that impression. You're right about a person's life. I've got a life, you know, take me in the totality of my actions and I'll tell you, I will stand with my record. One must be very careful one gets into these arguments and we try to do it. But, you know, we try on this show to do serious and controversial issues. And it's a big country and it's a free country. We don't put liberals down. We don't put people down with whom we disagree. We talk about serious things in a serious way. And if you're not allowed to talk about these subjects, then it's not the country it's supposed to be. You've got to be able to condemn these horrible ideas as I did. HANNITY:  Bill Bennett, appreciate you being on the program. BENNETT:  Thank you. Thank you guys. HANNITY:  Thank you very much.

The  National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago  ( search ) business barometer rose to 60.5 from 49.2 in August to almost reverse the drop seen last month. Economists had forecast the index at 51.0. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. Apart from August's somewhat mysterious slide, the index has been above that demarcation line separating economic growth from contraction since May 2003. Analysts said the report showed that the U.S. economy had significant momentum going into Hurricanes Katrina and Rita over the past month. \"It certainly suggests that the storms' impact was temporary, as the Fed and others had suggested,\" said Rick Egelton, chief economist at  BMO Financial Group  ( search ) in Toronto. New orders raced to 63.4 from 46.5 in August, and the order backlog rose to 54.3 from 45.7 last month. Katrina \"ironically may have had a positive effect on this index because of the big surge in new orders and, to a lesser extent, production,\" said Cary Leahey, senior managing director at Decision Economics. The employment component of the index fell to 48.4 from 51.7 in August, suggesting hiring in the Chicago region might have hit a roadblock. Prices paid jumped to 76.3 from 62.9 as prices for fuel and other raw materials stayed high. Many view the NAPM-Chicago as an industrial indicator, even though service sector companies are also polled, because the Chicago region, including parts of surrounding states, is relatively industrialized. Analysts now look to Monday's national  Institute for Supply Management  ( search ) factory activity report for clearer direction after recent mixed news on manufacturing from several regional surveys.", "date": "2015-03-25"},

Watch   \"The O'Reilly Factor\"   weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET and listen to the   \"Radio Factor!\" BILL O'REILLY, HOST:  Continuing now with our lead story, a victory for the  ACLU  ( search ). Federal  Judge Alvin Hellerstein  ( search ) says the government must release more  Abu Ghraib  ( search ) abuse photos. With us now Norm Siegel, former director for the  New York Civil Liberties Union  ( search ). All right, now look, I got - you have - we both read the decision here. And I'm very, very troubled by this, because I believe that people will die. Americans will die because of Hellerstein's decision. Now I understand he lives in theoretical world. But the reason that we have national security and the reason that we have classified documents is to prevent the deaths of people. Now the left made a big deal out of  Valerie Plame  ( search ). You remember that? With  Karl Rove  ( search ) and allegedly leaking her name, remember the story? Because the left said gee, poor Valerie might be in danger. Now we know that these soldiers are in danger if these pictures get out there. We know that, that it's going to incite violence. Yet Hellerstein says the publication of the photographs is essential to the purposes of FOIA because they initiate debate. How much more debate do we have to have over Abu Ghraib? We've already had almost a year of debate. We've already seen countless photos. Why do we need more? NORMAN SIEGEL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY:  Well, first of all, the photos, he's redacting all identity of anyone in the pictures. Second, and you mentioned FOIA, what you forgot to talk about is the rule of law. In this country, we have the Freedom of Information Act, which specifically says that we want an open and honest government. We want an informed citizenry, so we could have accountability. The government brought in the argument at a late point. The ACLU said to the judge don't take their argument. He took it, he analyzed it. He came down in different way than you wanted him to come down. This is a good judge, a smart judge, someone who's very balanced. In this decision, 50 pages, the government didn't lose everything. You're picking on one point which is very important, but this decision is balanced. This decision and this judge makes me proud to be an American and proud to be a lawyer. O'REILLY:  All right. Do you agree with me that any more pictures released from this, showing abuse of Muslims, will lead to violence against Americans? Do you agree with that statement? SIEGEL:  I don't know for sure. O'REILLY:  You don't know for sure. SIEGEL:  I know that... O'REILLY:  You saw the 15 dead after the \"Newsweek\" stuff, right? SIEGEL:  I understand, but what I love about America is that we are prepared to practice what we preach. O'REILLY:  All right, but to show the theoretical... SIEGEL:  We are prepared to show our negatives. No, it's not theoretical. O'REILLY:  Yes, it is. This is all theoretical. Suppression of information is the surest way to cause the significance to grow and persist. SIEGEL:  That's principle. It's not theoretical. O'REILLY:  No, it's theoretical, because we all - we aren't suppressing anything. We know the story. SIEGEL:  If... O'REILLY:  The story's been out. There's no suppression. This is just more stuff. SIEGEL:  It's under the law. Hellerstein says that we can't be blackmailed. When General Myers says the worst fears, and you say that it will lead to deaths, no one wants deaths. Hellerstein says that's not sufficient for me to ignore my obligation to enforce the law. O'REILLY:  So Hellerstein says that if soldiers die, and American civilians, too, because this kind of insightful, emotional violence could take any kind of turn. It's more important to do a theoretical argument about transparency and accountability, which we've already had. See, look, if this were a new story, if this were a story nobody knew about, if this were a story that led to the indictment of a colonel, I would say you have to do it. There's nothing new here. This is just piling on. SIEGEL:  Now what could be new is that further discussion of how this happened, why it happened... O'REILLY:  Oh, come on. SIEGEL:  ...and who should be held accountable. O'REILLY:  How many more discussions do you have? It's horrible. You indict. You just heard our military analysts say they should go higher. SIEGEL:  Yes, but they haven't. They're low level at this point. O'REILLY:  But there's no evidence in these pictures. SIEGEL:  Look, the pictures tell the story better than anything else. O'REILLY:  The story's been told. SIEGEL:  Well, I don't think enough Americans understand what happened there. O'REILLY:  Come on. 50 front-page stories on the  New York Times  ( search )? SIEGEL:  The point is that understand the  Freedom of Information  ( search ) law, I think that Hellerstein \u2014 and you're going to be surprised when the appeal occurs \u2014 I believe that the appeals courts will uphold Hellerstein. O'REILLY:  No way. SIEGEL:  His decision is... O'REILLY:  The Supreme Court is never, never... SIEGEL:  I'm talking about the Second Circuit. I didn't say this is about... O'REILLY:  I don't care. It's going to the Supreme Court unless the government's too cowardly to take it there. And they may be. They're not looking for their guys, as I told you. I mean, this government, the Bush administration's got big problem now. They got a big problem. SIEGEL:  Well, when we talk about freedom, and Bush talks about freedom, this is what freedom's about. O'REILLY:  This isn't... SIEGEL:  America is prepared to show even its negative side. O'REILLY:  This is abuse of freedom. SIEGEL:  It is not an abuse of freedom. O'REILLY:  This never would have happened in World War II. Impossible. Wouldn't have happened because Franklin Delano Roosevelt made sure it wouldn't happen, because he looked out for his guys. SIEGEL:  No, it's not that. In 60 years since World War II, we've developed greater respect for rights of people. O'REILLY:  Oh, I see. So we wouldn't have any freedom during World War II. SIEGEL:  No we had... O'REILLY:  Now we have that. SIEGEL:  We have plenty of freedom. Don't put words in my mouth. O'REILLY:  So Roosevelt was a fascist for protecting this guy? SIEGEL:  Of course not. I love FDR. O'REILLY:  Well, he protected his guys. SIEGEL:  It's not just protecting his guys. It's about upholding the law. O'REILLY:  Well, this thing the Supreme Court will never, and I just want to see them appeal it to there. SIEGEL:  Well, when they appeal and we win, I'll come back. And you'll eat those words. O'REILLY:  And you're invited any time, Mr. Siegel. Thank you for coming. SIEGEL:  Always a pleasure, Bill. O'REILLY:  And just for your information, we contacted a bunch of politicians for reaction. And as usual, most of them are too afraid to say anything. We got no comments from everyone, including  Hillary Clinton  ( search ),  Bill Frist  ( search ),  Ted Kennedy  ( search ),  John McCain  ( search ). Nobody wants to get involved.

African Sentenced for Lion-Pen Death", "content": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa \u2013  A white farmer convicted in the murder of one of his former black workers who was thrown into a  lion  ( search ) enclosure was sentenced Friday to life in prison. Mark Scott-Crossley  ( search ) and one of his employees were convicted in April of the January 2004 killing of  Nelson Chisale  ( search ) in a case that shocked a nation still coming to grips with its apartheid past. Scott-Crossley's employee and co-defendant, Simon Mathebula, was sentenced to 15 years because the judge said there were substantial and compelling circumstances to justify a lesser sentence. Chisale, 41, had been fired two months earlier for apparently running a personal errand during work hours. When he returned to pick up some belongings, he was beaten with machetes, tied up, driven to a nearby lion reserve, and thrown over the fence. Judge George Maluleke in the northern town of Phalaborwa said court guidelines say life sentences should be imposed when society needed to be protected from the possibility of a repeat offense or because the offense was so monstrous that it demanded harsh punishment. \"No crime fits this description more than the one before me and there is no doubt it would warrant this extreme punishment,\" the judge said. According to testimony at the trial, Chisale was assaulted with machetes on Jan. 31, 2004 and tied to a stake. After being tied up and bleeding for six or seven hours, Chisale was taken to the Mokwalo White Lion Project and thrown over the fence, screaming as the animals tore at his body. Maluleke said Scott-Crossley had masterminded the attack, forcing his employees to participate in the crime. Witnesses at the trial portrayed Scott-Crossley as a man with a history of aggression and violence. The judge said Mathebula had limited participation in the crime and had nothing to gain from the death of Chisale, whom he had befriended and visited. \"More importantly, he disclosed to the police his complicity in the crime shortly after he was arrested,\" the judge said. The trial of a third defendant, Richard Mathebula, a former Scott-Crossley employee who is no relation of Simon Mathebula, was postponed until November because of illness. A fourth man originally accused, Robert Mnisi, was given immunity from prosecution when he agreed to testify for the state. Scott-Crossley, who was married by a magistrate Friday morning before his sentencing, was led from the courtroom along with his new wife. His attorney, Charl van Tonder, said the verdict and the sentence would be appealed. Mathebula's legal aid-appointed lawyer, Mduduzi Thabede, also said he intended to appeal. The case highlighted the currents of violence that run through impoverished rural areas, as well as the harsh treatment meted out to farm laborers, who are usually black or mixed-race, by their bosses, who are usually white.", "date": "2015-03-25"}
