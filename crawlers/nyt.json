{"title": "Leda and the Swan: A Fresco Comes to Life in Pompeii Excavation", "description": "An expensive excavation campaign to shore up an at-risk area of the city is a constant font of archaeological discoveries.", "author": "By Elisabetta Povoledo", "content": "ROME \u2014 The ancient Pompeian fresco depicting the mythological scene of Leda and the swan was well preserved. It shows the rape of the queen of Sparta by Jupiter, the Romans\u2019 Zeus, in the form of a swan. The archaeological treasure, unearthed this month in the bedroom of a house being excavated on the Via del Vesuvio in Pompeii, was the latest find from an extensive excavation campaign to secure some of the fragile archaeological site\u2019s most at-risk areas. \u201cThis is one of the most critical areas of Pompeii,\u201d Massimo Osanna, the site\u2019s director general, said in a video, which shows an archaeologist carefully brushing centuries of earth from the Leda fresco, which was buried \u2014 along with the rest of the city \u2014 under ash, lapilli and rubble when Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D. The recovery of the house is part of a large-scale intervention, known as the Great Pompeii Project, in the Regio V sector of the city, begun in July 2017 with funds from the European Union. The project involves excavating and securing more than two miles of earth that border an unexcavated area of the ancient city. The archaeological remains along this front have suffered in recent years as a result of collapses and landslides caused by heavy rains. The remodeling will gradually decrease the slope of the hill, and is expected to drastically reduce the pressure created by the earth on the excavated structures. Mr. Osanna said in a phone interview that the Leda fresco was merely the latest of the excavation campaign\u2019s many finds. \u201cThere have been extraordinary discoveries,\u201d he said. In August, archaeologists also unearthed in an adjacent room of the same house a fresco of the fertility god Priapus weighing a phallus. Erotic works of classical mythology were popular in first-century Pompeii, Mr. Osanna said, including the Greek myth of Leda, the Spartan queen and wife of Tyndareus. She was seduced and raped by Zeus in swan form, before having intercourse with her husband. There are variations to the myth; one holds that Helen, blamed for the Trojan War, and the twins Castor and Pollux were hatched from two eggs from these unions. Mr. Osanna said that the presence of the Leda and Priapus frescoes in the house suggested that the owner, likely to have been a freed slave who had made good, was showing off his family\u2019s power. \u201cThese are iconographies that this specific social and political class liked,\u201d he said. Antonio Varone, a former director of the excavations at Pompeii, and the author of a book about Pompeian erotic art, said that sex was seen as \u201ca natural impulse\u201d in ancient times, and that in many cases, homeowners \u201csought to entertain guests\u201d while showing off their erudition. \u201cThese scenes would not have been scandalous; we find even cruder scenes\u201d at some sites, he said. This year, the excavations on Via del Vesuvio included two houses \u201cwith extraordinary mosaics and frescoes,\u201d Mr. Osanna said. Skeletons were found in one dwelling, as well as a charcoal inscription etched on a wall; Pompeii officials said it supported the theory that Vesuvius erupted in October and not in August, as tradition holds. The inscription (posted by Mr. Osanna on Instagram) was found in a room that had been undergoing renovations, and gives a date corresponding to Oct. 17. Pompeii officials suggested in a news release that the inscription dates \u201cto a week prior to the great catastrophe.\u201d This year, archaeologists also found the skeleton of a man who was initially thought to have been crushed by a rock as he tried to escape, though later findings cast doubt on that theory. Excavations will continue into the spring, while the remainder of 2019 will be dedicated to securing the areas that have been unearthed to make them accessible to the public, Mr. Osanna said. At least 54 acres of the ancient city remain underground. \u201cWe could dig for years, decades, even centuries, but we prefer to leave that to future generations,\u201d he said.", "date": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/europe/pompeii-fresco-leda-swan-zeus.html"},

{"title": "Rio de Janeiro Elevator Attendants \u2018Adore\u2019 Their Dying, Chatty Trade", "description": "It seemed to be the occupation that automation somehow forgot. But elevator attendants are now losing in droves the jobs they love. When they disappear, so will a sociable slice of the city\u2019s life.", "author": "By Ernesto Londo\u00f1o", "content": "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The elevator attendants are under no illusion: Their days are numbered. Yet the few thousand operators in Rio de Janeiro who have clung on to their jobs well into the 21st century are hoping the forces of automation won\u2019t entirely obliterate their trade, at least for a few more years. \u201cYou\u2019re never bored,\u201d said Roselia da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, 53, as she ferried passengers up and down a 23-story building in downtown Rio de Janeiro one morning, commanding her bouncy elevator from a tall stool. \u201cBecause you\u2019re always talking and interacting with people, you learn a lot and you create a type of intimacy,\u201d she said. While Rio de Janeiro may be best known for its fantastic beaches and hillside favelas, the city, which was Brazil\u2019s capital until 1960, remains one of the country\u2019s major business centers, and its downtown is crowded with high-rises and corporate headquarters. In 1991, a state law made it mandatory for commercial buildings with five or more stories to employ elevator attendants, which is the main reason the city still has a small army of some 4,000 operators, said Sandro das Neves, one of the leaders of the elevator operator union. Board elevators in all sorts of buildings downtown and you will be greeted, again and again, by attendants, some immaculately uniformed. It feels as if you are stepping back in time for a few seconds, in a pleasant, yet also bewildering way. The ride between floors becomes a chance for a brief, but sociable encounter \u2014 the sort of small talk that used to happen all the time at the grocery checkout line, the bank and the airline check-in counter before artificial intelligence and touch screens phased out those human interactions (and those jobs). But the trade of elevator operator, which reached its global heyday in the age of telephone operators and has survived in Rio into the dawn of the driverless car era, may finally be fading away in this city. Despite the law protecting the jobs of elevator operators, many lost their jobs in recent years as building managers cut costs during a period of economic recession that hit this city particularly hard. Then came what will likely turn out to be the fatal blow. Earlier this year, a court struck down the 1991 law, siding with state lawyers who argued that the requirement posed unreasonable burdens on building owners. Since then, Mr. das Neves said, the union, which once fought for better working conditions, is now simply devoted to survival. \u201cOur fight is not to raise wages,\u201d he said, noting that elevators operators make about $290 a month. \u201cIt\u2019s merely to keep attendants inside elevators.\u201d Manuel Fernandes do Prado, who at 77 is well past retirement age, is in charge of the lift at a building on President Vargas Avenue, the main street that crosses downtown Rio de Janeiro. What does he think of his job? \u201cI adore it!\u201d he said. Mr. Fernandes, who has been in the business for more than 40 years, sometimes works back-to-back shifts in different buildings. He said he enjoyed tracking the lives of regulars as they age. It\u2019s easy to do when you see people daily, he said, often at predictable hours. He notices when they walk in feeling chipper, when they seem upset, when something is wrong. \u201cLife is good when you work surrounded by people,\u201d Mr. Fernandes said. Addressing a regular passenger, he asked, \u201cDid you ever see me sad?\u201d Ms. da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o said the job wasn\u2019t quite as obsolete as it may seem. Many elevators in the city are several decades old and have been repaired using custom-made parts since the models are no longer sold. Keeping them operational requires someone who knows how to handle all the cranks, quirks and funny noises of the aging, fussy machines. And a steady hand when they malfunction, as they often do. \u201cWhen an elevator breaks down, the only person who can\u2019t panic is the operator,\u201d she said. That speaks to a phenomenon Jacob Carlos Lima, a professor of sociology at the Federal University of S\u00e3o Carlos in S\u00e3o Paulo, has studied in several sectors of Brazil\u2019s economy. While some factory jobs have been eliminated by technological advances, poor infrastructure has spared several occupations, he said. \u201cAutomation in Brazil will be limited by deficient infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat good is a driverless car if we\u2019re gridlocked on top of an overpass?\u201d Ms. da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o said the job certainly had downsides. Being confined to the small, windowless cube for hours has taken a toll on her figure. \u201cWhen I started, I was thin,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cLook at me now, I\u2019m older and voluminous.\u201d But it\u2019s a job she\u2019d love to continue doing for at least seven years, when she\u2019ll be eligible to retire. \u201cThe profession is going to end,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re over 50, you can\u2019t easily get another job.\u201d", "date": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/americas/brazil-rio-de-janeiro-elevator-attendants.html"},

Bailey and Matt Stevens", "content": "Ricky Jay, a revered sleight-of-hand magician who shined light on centuries of illusionists and consulted with Hollywood to make the impossible seem real, died on Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 72. His longtime manager, Winston Simone, confirmed his death. Mr. Jay was known for his command of cards, whether conjuring them with precision or flinging them into the rind of a watermelon. He frequented talk shows and performed in several one-man shows directed by the playwright David Mamet, including \u201cRicky Jay and His 52 Assistants.\u201d The consulting company Mr. Jay founded with Michael Weber in the 1990s, Deceptive Practices, worked with directors in Hollywood and on Broadway to create illusions. He also appeared in movies like \u201cBoogie Nights,\u201d \u201cMagnolia,\u201d \u201cTomorrow Never Dies\u201d and \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d as well as the television series \u201cDeadwood.\u201d A student of his craft, Mr. Jay collected artifacts from magic\u2019s history and often wrote about magicians who might otherwise have been forgotten. There was a limit to what he would share, however. Mr. Jay was adamant about preserving the mystery behind his tricks. \u201cMost people realize that magical powers are not being invoked and that it\u2019s someone who\u2019s created a way to mystify and entertain you,\u201d Mr. Jay told The New York Times in 2002. \u201cThe key to that is surprise. If you\u2019re giving away the method, you\u2019re denying someone the surprise.\u201d Richard Jay Potash was born in Brooklyn before his family moved to the New Jersey suburbs, according to a 1993 profile in The New Yorker. But Mr. Jay did not like to reveal his age or discuss his childhood, telling the magazine, \u201cI grew up like Athena \u2014 covered with playing cards instead of armor \u2014 and, at the age of 7, materialized on a TV show, doing magic.\u201d And Mr. Jay kept doing it, developing into a magician many considered the greatest sleight-of-hand artist in the world. He \u201cdefined the terms of his art\u201d for the Encyclopaedia Britannica, according to a biography on his website. Audiences were often flummoxed by Mr. Jay\u2019s card tricks. When pressured to impress at a dinner party, he told a guest to pick a card. After the guest named the three of hearts, Mr. Jay shuffled, gripped the deck and flung it across the table, causing the cards to strike an open wine bottle, according to The New Yorker. To the guest\u2019s dismay, the three of hearts appeared inside the bottle\u2019s neck. Mr. Jay also frequently wrote and spoke on odd and varied subjects that were adjacent to magic, such as con games and sense perception. He was once the curator of the Mulholland Library of Conjuring and the Allied Arts and had been elected to membership in the American Antiquarian Society, his online biography said. Among the overlooked showmen he brought back to life with his research and writing: Matthias Buchinger, an 18th-century German with no hands or feet, and Max Malini, who turned coins into ice in the early 20th century. \u201cI sort of think of Ricky as the intellectual elite of magicians,\u201d the actor Steve Martin told The New Yorker. \u201cRicky\u2019s a master of his craft.\u201d Asked by The Times about duplicity for a 2013 article, Mr. Jay, who is survived by his wife, Chrisann Verges, argued: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to live in a world where you couldn\u2019t be conned. Because it would mean you\u2019re living in a world where you never trusted anyone or anything.\u201d", "date": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/obituaries/ricky-jay-dead.html"},

{"title": "85 Years Later, Ukraine Marks Famine That Killed Millions", "description": "With each passing year, fewer witnesses to the tragedy of the Great Famine of 1932 and 1933, are still alive.", "author": "By Iuliia Mendel", "content": "KIEV, Ukraine \u2014 His frail hand covering his heart, Mykhailo Matvienko, 92, peered at the yellow flame of a candle on his kitchen table on Saturday and recounted his childhood during the Great Famine. A searing event seen as one of the great atrocities of 20th-century Europe, the Ukrainian famine of 1933 killed more than three million people, by most estimates, and has become a touchstone in post-Soviet Ukrainian society. \u201cIt is very important to remember the famine,\u201d Mr. Matvienko said. He lit his first candle in the morning, and kept them burning through the day. On Saturday, Ukrainians lit candles on their tables or windowsills to commemorate the famine, called the Holodomor, which means death by hunger in Ukrainian. The atrocity is marked annually on the fourth Saturday of November. But every year, fewer survivors remain alive to offer their firsthand accounts of the famine, a brutal narrative that for many Ukrainians helps make the case against Russian influence in the country today. Ukrainian historians argue that the famine was a genocide orchestrated by Joseph Stalin, then head of the Soviet Union, to crush Ukrainian aspirations for independence. While the famine of 1932 and 1933 brought on by the forced collectivization of farms undeniably affected other parts of the Soviet Union, in Ukraine, entire villages were cut off and their inhabitants left to starve. The famine began in Kazakhstan and southern Russia but hit Ukraine hardest. \u201cThe specific policies implemented in Ukraine were known to be lethal,\u201d Timothy Snyder, a Yale historian and the author of a book about the period, \u201cBloodlands,\u201d said in an interview. \u201cSoviet documents make it clear that Ukrainians were to be blamed for the disaster of collectivization and that death was to be deliberately concentrated in Ukraine.\u201d The Soviet Union exported grain from Ukraine even as its inhabitants starved. Estimates by Western historians put the death toll between 3.3 and 3.9 million Ukrainians, Mr. Snyder said. Russia, which has today formally designated Ukraine an area within its zone of \u201cprivileged interest,\u201d has pushed back against this interpretation. On Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry  issued a statement saying that the famine in the Soviet Union, \u201ctouched many people living on the territory of the young state.\u201d \u201cIt became the common tragedy of the Russians, the Ukrainians, the Kazakhs and other nationalities,\u201d the statement read. In Ukraine on Saturday, survivors were honored guests at memorial events. But many are now too frail to attend. Mr. Matvienko, the youngest of seven children, was just 6 when the famine began in the winter of 1932. The crops harvested in his village were taken, and those who sought to stockpile food were shot, he recalled. Soon, the dogs, cats and rats vanished, too. \u201cThe village was scary, everything was dead,\u201d he said. \u201cNo dogs or roosters were heard. People ate everything: dogs, cats, rats. Frogs were delicacies in spring.\u201d Mr. Matvienko\u2019s stomach swelled from hunger, he remembered. People died on the streets and their bodies were left unburied, he said. His father was arrested and killed but the remainder of the family managed to survive. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle,\u201d he said. At the formal commemoration on Saturday, a solemn ceremony at the Museum of the Holodomor, Ukrainian politicians lit votive candles in memory of the lives lost. \u201cOur moral duty is to write every innocent name in the history book of memory, because it is absolutely necessary and a warning to humanity from repeating such crimes,\u201d President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine said during the ceremony. Since 2006, when Ukraine adopted a law designating the famine a genocide, 18 countries and 21 American states have followed suit. The State Department on Friday issued a statement calling the events a \u201ccatastrophic man-made famine\u201d and \u201cone of the most atrocious acts of the 20th century and a brutal reminder of the crimes of communism.\u201d", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/europe/ukraine-holodomor-famine-memorial.html"},
{"title": "PETA Has a Suggestion for a Village Named Wool", "description": "The animal rights group sent a letter asking the English village to change its name to Vegan Wool, provoking surprise and ridicule. ", "author": "By Palko Karasz", "content": "LONDON \u2014 It began, PETA says, as a playful attempt to draw attention to animal cruelty in the wool industry: The animal rights group sent a letter asking the English village of Wool to change its name to Vegan Wool.  But the letter from the British branch of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, received on Wednesday by village officials, attracted scorn and ridicule from residents of Wool after it was posted on Facebook by the local parish council clerk, according to news reports.  \u201cWith a simple name change, your village can take a stand against this cruelty,\u201d Elisa Allen, director of PETA\u2019s London office, wrote, pointing to evidence of mistreatment of sheep on farms around the world. In exchange for the name change, Ms. Allen said, \u201cwe\u2019d be happy to provide every Vegan Wool household that would like one with a cozy, cruelty-free blanket.\u201d PETA recently published graphic videos showing workers on British farms punching animals while they sheared the wool. The group wanted to draw attention to the footage by sending the letter, Ms. Allen said in a phone interview on Friday.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a benign industry \u2014 it\u2019s not a haircut as people often assume it is,\u201d she said.  The parish council of Wool, in the county of Dorset, 120 miles southwest of London, said in an email on Friday that PETA\u2019s \u201crequest has not been received very well.\u201d  Headlines in traditionally conservative tabloids cried foul, saying that PETA believed the name Wool promoted animal cruelty when it was actually linked to water, and quoting residents who ridiculed the suggested name change.   \u201cWe would be the laughingstock of Dorset if we agreed,\u201d Alan Brown, 81, who hails from a family that has made hurdles to pen sheep for generations, was quoted as saying in The Times of London.  For one thing, this ancient village of 5,000 people in the verdant countryside of England was not named after the wool from sheep. True, in the 19th century it was known for sheep of the Dorset Down breed, but most farms have turned to dairy production, the paper said. The name Wool, which is more than 1,000 years old, derives from Wyllon or Well, which means spring, the council said. Ms. Allen said PETA knew that, and wanted only to draw attention to its campaign in a \u201cfun way.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to look a little bit silly provided that we can bring these issues into the public domain,\u201d she said.  But PETA\u2019s letter touched a nerve with some vegans and animal rights activists.  \u201cI know it gets people talking, but for all the wrong reasons,\u201d Sean Ryan Fox, a software designer, said on Twitter. He said such actions \u201ccontribute negatively to the reputation of veganism.\u201d An activist for Brooke, a group that campaigns for the protection of working horses, also wrote on Twitter, \u201cI understand why they do it, but by doing absurd campaigns like this, I think PETA are ignoring the damage that they\u2019re doing to the reputation of vegans.\u201d  The suggestion that vegan-friendly names can be good publicity is not unfamiliar in Britain, where veganism is increasingly popular. Just this past week, a pub in the city of York changed its name from the Shoulder of Mutton to the Heworth Inn as it began offering a vegan and vegetarian menu.  This month, the editor of a food magazine resigned after provoking outrage with his response to a pitch from a vegan writer: \u201cHow about a series on killing vegans one by one.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time that PETA has caused a stir by targeting a place\u2019s name. In 1996, the group suggested changing the name of Fishkill, N.Y., to Fishsave. In Britain, Ms. Allen said, the group had unsuccessfully proposed that the English city of Nottingham call itself Not-eating-ham. As for Wool, the parish clerk said in the email that because PETA had made its request in writing, officials would consider the letter at a meeting next month.", "date": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/europe/uk-peta-wool-village.html"},
{"title": "Doubles Win Keeps French Hopes Alive at Davis Cup Final", "description": "Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert of France beat Croatia\u2019s Ivan Dodig and Mate Pavic in the doubles on Saturday in four sets.", "author": "By The Associated Press", "content": "LILLE, France \u2014 Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert kept French hopes alive in the Davis Cup final with a 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (3) win over Croatia\u2019s Ivan Dodig and Mate Pavic in the doubles on Saturday. Croatia now leads France, 2-1, as it chases its first Davis Cup title since 2005. Croatia headed into the second day of the final needing only one more point against France, the defending champion, after its singles players Borna Coric and Marin Cilic outplayed J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in straight sets on Friday and without conceding a single break of serve on the opening day. On the indoor clay court installed at the Pierre Mauroy stadium in northern France, the script changed dramatically during a pulsating doubles match. Dodig and Pavic had only a few chances in the first two sets. Herbert played aggressively and Mahut raised his game on important points, hitting a service winner in the fourth game of the opening set to deny Croatia\u2019s sole break chance in that set. The Croatian pair gradually found their rhythm and made the most of Herbert\u2019s sudden dip of level on serve to force a fourth set. Pavic saved three match points with consecutive big serves in the 10th game but the hosts played solid tennis in the tiebreaker to prevail. Chasing an 11th title in the team event, France is back in the final but still faces a big challenge. The French singles players looked out of their depths on Friday, casting doubt on the chances of a comeback in Sunday\u2019s reverse singles. Cilic is set to face Chardy, with Coric playing Tsonga, although captains can change their lineups. No team has overturned a 2-0 deficit in a final since Australia beat the United States in 1939. Mahut and Herbert have lost just one match together in the Davis Cup \u2014 against Croatia two years ago. They broke for a 4-3 lead in the opener after a series of aggressive returns that put Dodig on the back foot. They sealed the first set after dropping just six points on their service games. The French duo applied pressure on Dodig\u2019s serve in the ninth game of the second set, and a return that hit the net cord gave France two break points. A second double fault from Dodig in that game sealed the break for the hosts, who held for the set. Pavic missed an easy forehand volley at the start of the third set to drop his serve, but the Croats did not go down without a fight. They took advantage of Herbert\u2019s mistakes to break back and then moved into a 5-3 lead after a thunderous forehand pass from the left-handed Pavic silenced the home crowd and the French paid the price for their mistakes at the net. Herbert struggled again on his serve as the French looked on the verge of a collapse at the start of the fourth, but he fought through a 13-minute game. Under pressure on his next service game, Herbert once again found the ability to get out of trouble as a lob from Dodig bounced just inches out. Trailing, 0-40, on his serve with the French up, 5-4, and facing jeers from French fans, the 25-year-old Pavic showed the nerves of a seasoned veteran. He turned toward the French supporters and gestured as if to ask them to make more noise. He then launched consecutive service winners to fend off three match points and hold with a drop volley. But the French were more composed in the tiebreaker and earned three more match points after Dodig went long with a forehand, and Herbert produced a winning serve. Mahut converted the first match point with a fine reflex volley.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/sports/tennis/france-croatia-davis-cup-final.html"},

Game Ever", "description": "Texas A&M ended a streak of seven losses against L.S.U. with its first win over the Tigers since 1995.", "author": "By The Associated Press", "content": "Kellen Mond\u2019s 2-point conversion pass to Kendrick Rogers in the seventh overtime gave Texas A&M a 74-72 victory at home over No. 8 Louisiana State on Saturday night. The 146 combined points are the most in a top-level game in N.C.A.A. history and the second-most in college football history, behind the 161 points scored in Abilene Christian\u2019s 93-68 win over West Texas A&M in 2008. The previous record-holder for scoring at the top level, now known as the Football Bowl Subdivision, was a 2016 game in which Pitt beat Syracuse, 76-61. Saturday\u2019s game also tied the record for most overtimes in an F.B.S. contest; four other games share the mark. The Aggies\u2019 74 points matched the total for their men\u2019s basketball team in its last game, a 74-62 win over South Alabama on Friday. Mond connected with Quartney Davis on a 17-yard throw to tie the score, 72-72. Greedy Williams was called for pass interference on the first 2-point conversion try, giving the Aggies (8-4, 5-3) another shot. After a false start by Texas A&M, Mond found Rogers for the conversion to end it. Joe Burrow had a 10-yard touchdown run to put L.S.U. (9-3, 5-3), No. 7 in the College Football Playoff rankings, up by 72-66 in the seventh overtime, but his 2-point conversion throw failed. The 74 points that L.S.U. allowed are the most ever given up by a ranked team, eclipsing the 73 that No. 24 Fresno State surrendered to Northern Illinois on Oct. 6, 1990. It was also the first seven-overtime game involving a ranked team. Mond threw for 287 yards, six touchdowns and three 2-point conversions and ran for one more touchdown as Texas A&M ended a streak of seven losses against L.S.U. with its first win over the Tigers since 1995. L.S.U. Coach Ed Orgeron was prematurely doused with Gatorade when the Tigers appeared to have a clinching interception in the fourth quarter. But the play was reviewed, and it was ruled that Mond\u2019s knee was down before the throw, keeping the Aggies alive and setting up the wild finish. Mond threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Jace Sternberger and a 2-point conversion to Rogers in the sixth overtime before Burrow had a 4-yard touchdown run and threw for the 2-point conversion to push it to a seventh overtime. Clyde Edwards-Helaire took a pitch from Burrow and launched an 11-yard touchdown pass to Tory Carter to put the Tigers on top in the fifth overtime, but the 2-point conversion failed. Mond answered with a 6-yard throw to Rogers, but A&M\u2019s 2-point try failed, too, to send it to the sixth overtime. Mond found Quartney Davis on a 19-yard touchdown pass on the last play of regulation to send it to overtime. Both teams kicked field goals in the fourth overtime to send it to the fifth. Burrow threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Dee Anderson in triple overtime, and Justin Jefferson grabbed the 2-point conversion. Rogers made it 49-49 and forced quadruple overtime when he grabbed a 25-yard touchdown pass and the 2-point conversion. Both teams settled for field goals in the first overtime. Mond had a 3-yard touchdown run in double overtime, and L.S.U. sent it to triple overtime when Nick Brossette followed with a 3-yard run.", "date": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/sports/lsu-texas-am-seventh-overtime.html"},
{"title": "Silent Finales", "description": "Joon Pahk\u2019s Sunday puzzle speaks softly and carries a big trick.", "author": "By Caitlin Lovinger", "content": "SUNDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Joon Pahk is one of those fearsome productive polycreators who solve competitively, invent new games, dominate on Jeopardy and so on. Solving a puzzle by a mind like this, in my opinion, gives us a little window into the creativity within, and always causes a great deal of envious admiration in me as I\u2019m filling in the grid. I found this puzzle graceful and elegant as well. This was a slow solve for me; some of the names weren\u2019t in my bailiwick, like THAYER, ENSENADA and ELSIE. There was a little sprinkle of difficult terms as well, including some watery ones like SHELF, SHALLOWS, RILL and SEA LEVEL. I enjoyed many of the puns in the fill immensely: THUMB and TAT were laughers. 22A: I recognize the term APOLOGIA, but over time I\u2019d drifted away from its meaning as a \u201cformal defense.\u201d There\u2019s a fine line between regret and resolve, I guess you\u2019d say.  25A: I loved this deceptive double pun and spent a big chunk of solving this corner committed to the use of \u201cforce\u201d somewhere in the entry. At one point I decided it might be a more advanced notation \u2014 Faraday? Friction? \u2014 but it turned out to be way more basic. If you MISSPELL \u201cphysics,\u201d you might use an \u201cf.\u201d 88A: This entry is mythological, and practically a debut \u2014 the only previous appearance of LETHEAN was in 1942! I love words getting brought back. The reference is to the river Lethe, one of the five rivers of Hades, the Greek underworld. This river figured in Dante\u2019s \u201cPurgatorio\u201d as a conundrum \u2014 the writer needed to immerse himself to absolve his sins, by forgetting them, but in order to narrate his journey he had to remember having sinned. 78D: We\u2019ve had some old galley ships in the puzzle this year, and I\u2019d stumbled on \u201cbiremes\u201d at one point \u2014 I was sure enough of this fitting here that I looked for a rebus for a while. My seafaring vocabulary is spotty and I\u2019d already considered BRIG to mean a naval prison cell, as it has so often been wittily clued (\u201cclink on the drink?\u201d \u201cwater cooler?\u201d etc.). A BRIG can be a two-masted ship, though, and is also different from a brigantine. People are quite impassioned by this nomenclature. 83D: I filled this in easily but didn\u2019t get it \u2014 \u201cHeading in the right direction,\u201d assuming you\u2019re facing north, is indeed EAST, as a label (\u201cheading\u201d). 96D: I found this to be another clever little clue that took me a few go-rounds to appreciate. A \u201cPerson who\u2019s hard to take,\u201d someone who argues about everything, or is just a general wet blanket, earned the nickname PILL a long time ago \u2014 something unpleasant and hard to swallow. I haven\u2019t heard this reference in ages, though. There are nine theme entries today, sprinkled through the acrosses and downs at 23A, 38A, 67A, 93A, 115A, 3D, 16D, 46D and 81D. The trick boils down to a simple little silent \u201cE\u201d that, on paper, changes the whole meaning of a word, and therefore makes a common phrase into something else entirely, something that giddily fits its cryptic clue.  As an example, right at the top and pretty straightforward: 23A, \u201cPhoto caption for the winning team\u2019s M.V.P. being carried off the field?\u201d The answer, A STAR IS BORNE, answers this question perfectly: The star of the game is being carried, or borne, away.  Nearly all the theme entries find that \u201cE\u201d at the very end of the phrase; a few, though, sneak it into the first element, which did make it trickier for me. One of them was at 16D, \u201cTwo things you might find in Sherwood Forest?\u201d Think Robin Hood: our hero and his righteous band of thieves in the woods, or COPSE AND ROBBERS. If you\u2019re the type who notices the title on Sundays, \u201cSilent Finale\u201d is really quite brilliant and explains the puzzle perfectly. It\u2019s hard to put my finger on it but if I were to use a musical analogy, we usually have pretty dynamic, noisy puzzles on Sunday, and this grid felt very pianissimo, in an enjoyable way. Even though this theme is clean as a whistle, I made a lot of missteps and wrong assumptions along the way, including looking for a rebus at one point, and struggled to come up with any of the phrases without a lot of help from crosses. And I also found the fill super tough! But after the fact, once everything fell into place it seemed a lot simpler than my solve felt \u2014 I like grids that do that. Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.  Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here.

{"title": "How New York Times Journalists Took the Measure of China\u2019s Rising Power", "description": "A Q. and A. with our managing editor, Joe Kahn, who spearheaded the China Rules series.", "author": "By Max Fisher", "content": "Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.  The New York Times conceived of China Rules, a special project, as a way to answer a deceptively simple question: How did China do it? The nation has defied Western norms, and expectations, to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy and the newest superpower. Almost a year in the making, and with collaboration from nearly all corners of the newsroom and correspondents around the world, the project explores how and why China achieved its stature. Max Fisher, who writes The Times\u2019s Interpreter column with Amanda Taub, recently spoke with The Times\u2019s managing editor, Joe Kahn, who directed the China Rules project. A lightly edited and condensed excerpt from their conversation follows. Q. How did this project come together?  A. In the beginning of each year, we have a series of enterprise meetings and brainstorming sessions. Tech people were talking about doing something on the competition between Silicon Valley and the Chinese tech giants. International was talking about Belt and Road and the projection of Chinese power and clashes in the South China Sea. Business was talking about some of the long-term threads. At the same time, we were in this environment where Trump was sounding the alarm on China. Out of all that came some discussion that we should really try to do something that is set apart. Not a series of typical newspaper stories about this or that about China, but something that made more of a statement that we\u2019re in a different world now. We\u2019ve all, in the past generation, grown up with a sense that there is a single superpower in the world, the United States, and most of the issues have been defined as for or against American interests around the world, like radical Islamist terrorism. That\u2019s changing, and it\u2019s time to just pause and make a statement that it\u2019s changing. We spent a big part of the initial effort just gathering data, looking for some of the harder metrics on very broad issues like social mobility or export power or the size of the Chinese internet, to see whether that could help us make some broader statements. It was an attempt, rather than looking for the usual newsy development that allows us to say something broader in the middle of the story, to broaden from the start and tell this in a more explanatory way. So we really set to put some bigger conclusions and data-driven analysis first, and then figure out the story. The tricky part is that, when you take on a big project like that early in 2018 and try to land it late in 2018, you don\u2019t know what the macro news environment is going to be. For all we knew at that time, we could be at war in the South China Sea, or on the Korean Peninsula, or Trump and Xi could become best friends and resolve the trade war. It kind of worked out, timing-wise, but we couldn\u2019t have known that. Is there anything surprising we\u2019ve learned about what kinds of China stories will pull people in? We tried something similar to this when I was an editor at The Atlantic seven or eight years ago, but it was hard to get people into it. It\u2019s still hard to get people into it. We have a giant investment in a really high-quality China staff, we translate a lot of things into Chinese, we have everyone from the science desk to Washington paying attention to it. The audience we have to this project is really a testament of the drawing power of The New York Times when we frame something well, present it well and promote it heavily \u2014 as opposed to there having been some unarticulated, deep desire for more China reporting that we\u2019d suddenly tapped into. It speaks to the role of the institution to pick a moment when people might not be pining for China coverage to say, \u201cActually, you should be paying attention to this.\u201d And it seems like they are. I hope so. I think that is a role that, ideally, from time to time, The New York Times can play. I think we play it pretty regularly on our big investigative efforts. It\u2019s not like people were saying, \u201cWhere\u2019s your story on Trump\u2019s family taxes?\u201d But when we deliver the story on Trump\u2019s family taxes, we create a moment around that and conversation around it. I think this is similar. You can\u2019t do it all the time, but when we pick our spots well, I think we can help focus the conversation.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/reader-center/china-rules-economy-special-section.html"},
{"title": "Retrieving Body of Missionary Killed on Remote Indian Island Is a Struggle", "description": "John Allen Chau\u2019s corpse has not been found. Those who have stepped ashore North Sentinel Island have been shot with bows and arrows.", "author": "By Jeffrey Gettleman, Hari Kumar and Kai Schultz", "content": "When Indian police officers in a small boat pulled within sight of the remote island, they saw something strange. A group of islanders were huddled on the beach. Carrying bows, arrows and spears, they appeared to be guarding something. Police officials said it could have been the body of John Allen Chau. The 26-year-old American missionary was killed last week as he tried to spread Christianity to North Sentinel, a forbidden island in the Andaman Sea with a long history of repelling outsiders. The crew turned off the boat\u2019s motor. They peered at the islanders through binoculars, making sure to stay several hundred yards off shore, out of bow-and-arrow range. \u201cThe Sentinelese were watchful,\u201d Dependra Pathak, the area\u2019s police chief, said on Saturday. \u201cThey were patrolling the beach, at the same spot John was killed, with weapons.\u201d \u201cHad we approached,\u201d he said, \u201cthey would have attacked.\u201d So instead of retrieving Mr. Chau\u2019s body or determining where it is, the police officers, after sketching out the crime scene, motored away. \u201cThis case is the strangest and toughest in my life,\u201d Mr. Pathak said. \u201cWe are trying to enter into another civilization\u2019s world.\u201d North Sentinel Island is home to one of the last undiluted hunter-and-gatherer societies, a rugged, Manhattan-sized island where a few dozen people live trapped in time and in total isolation. For decades, India has kept North Sentinel in a museum case. Mr. Chau\u2019s death has shattered the glass. Efforts to retrieve Mr. Chau\u2019s body \u2014 the first step in most murder investigations \u2014 are proving difficult and some anthropologists say it will be impossible. The search symbolizes the larger quandary India confronts in trying to enforce a society\u2019s rules in a place that has been intentionally set away from the rest of that society. Indian law says North Sentinel\u2019s culture is so precious and unique that its people should be left totally alone and no outsiders are allowed there. It also says that murderers should be punished. That is the bind police officers are facing. Last week, a group of fishermen reported seeing Mr. Chau\u2019s body buried on the beach, apparently after the islanders shot him with bows and arrows. But police officials have yet to locate a corpse. Just about anyone who has stepped ashore on this island has been attacked with bows and arrows and anthropologists are warning the government to move gingerly. \u201cYou can\u2019t take the Sentinelese for granted,\u201d said T.N. Pandit, an anthropologist who visited the island years ago. \u201cYou can\u2019t bring the army and take away the body. It\u2019s not like that. They need to observe utmost caution.\u201d Though the Andaman and Nicobar Island chain is India\u2019s farthest flung outpost, it is no longer so out of reach. The Indian government recently pushed to open more islands to tourism. The biggest town, Port Blair, has new resorts, new roads, new clothing shops, a major naval base, good cellular phone service and an increasingly busy airport. North Sentinel lies less than 35 miles away. The Indian Navy patrols the waters around the island, trying to make sure no outsiders ever reach it. But as Mr. Chau showed, that ring of security could easily be breached. On the night of Nov. 14, Mr. Chau, who lived in Washington state, set off under the cover of darkness with a group of fishermen he paid to take him to the island. A graduate of Oral Roberts University and a passionate Christian, Mr. Chau told friends he was willing to risk his life to bring Christianity to North Sentinel, a place so shrouded in mystery that the Indian government says no outsiders know the language or the customs of the people there. It is unclear what exactly happened to him. For two days, he used a kayak to paddle the half-mile between the boat and North Sentinel, where he rattled off passages from Genesis to the islanders. Sometimes the islanders simply stared at him. Other times they laughed. The frustration built. In a 13-page letter Mr. Chau gave to the fishermen, in which he detailed those failures to win over the islanders, he pleaded with God for clarity: \u201cI don\u2019t want to die. Who will take my place if I do?\u201d On the morning of Nov. 17, the fishermen saw a group of islanders dragging his body on the beach, then burying it in a shallow grave in the sand. The fishermen and one other man who the police say helped Mr. Chau reach the island have been arrested and charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and with violating rules protecting aboriginal tribes. Another case has been filed against \u201cunknown persons,\u201d the islanders, for killing Mr. Chau. The investigation is now heading into uncharted territory. On Friday, authorities sent police officers, along with some of the arrested fishermen, on a boat to observe North Sentinel and establish where Mr. Chau was killed. But will any of the islanders actually face prosecution? And if arrested, would they die in captivity from disease, their immune systems no match for modern microbes? In 2006, two crab fishermen were killed by islanders after washing up on North Sentinel\u2019s shores. Police officials are now poring through the records of those killings, looking for clues about what happened to the fishermen\u2019s bodies. Mr. Pathak said that about a week after the islanders buried the fishermen in shallow graves on the beach, they dug up the bodies and stood them up by tying them to lengths of bamboo. \u201cIf they follow the same pattern,\u201d Mr. Pathak said, they may soon take out Mr. Chau\u2019s body, although he suggested that it might never be recovered. In the case of the two fishermen, Mr. Pathak doesn\u2019t think their bodies were ever recovered and he seemed to indicate that was a possibility in this case as well. \u201cIf maybe, from a distance, we can see John\u2019s body, then at least his death gets fully established,\u201d he said. In his last letter, Mr. Chau was clear about what he wanted done in case he died. \u201cDon\u2019t retrieve my body,\u201d he wrote, underlining it. \u201cThis is not a pointless thing \u2014 the eternal lives of this tribe is at hand.\u201d", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/asia/north-sentinel-island-missionary-killed.html"},
{"title": "Another N.F.L. Owner Is Gone in a Year That Has Diminished the Old Guard", "description": "Bob McNair died on Friday, making the Texans the fifth team to say goodbye to its owner in 2018.", "author": "By Ken Belson", "content": "Every professional sports league is filled with owners who are doers, those who are followers and some silent types who speak up only when they must. In a relatively short period, the N.F.L. has lost a collection of all three types of owners. On Friday, the Houston Texans\u2019 founding owner, Bob McNair, died at 81 after a long battle with cancer. He became the fifth owner this year to die or to sell a team, an unusual amount of turnover in a league known for its stability. In October, the Seattle Seahawks owner, Paul G. Allen, died at 65 of complications from non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. A week before, Alex Spanos, who bought the San Diego Chargers in 1984, died at 95. In May, Jerry Richardson, the founding owner of the Carolina Panthers, sold his team after reports emerged accusing him of sexual harassment and using racial slurs. In March, Tom Benson, who bought a majority stake in the New Orleans Saints in 1985, died at 90. The five belonged to a fast-diminishing group of owners who were self-made business owners and more often than not came from humble beginnings. They made their fortunes in industries that boomed in the 1960s and 1970s, when they built their empires \u2014 in energy (McNair), car dealerships (Benson), fast-food franchises (Richardson) and home building (Spanos). Only Allen, who started Microsoft with Bill Gates, staked his claim in what might be considered a cutting edge industry. Given how much it costs to buy a team (the Panthers sold for $2.3 billion), it\u2019s hard to imagine many car dealers or fast-food franchisees being able to purchase an N.F.L. team in the future. The league now is increasingly dominated by billionaires capable of paying nine- and even 10-digit sums for teams, not the start-from-scratch entrepreneurs who cobbled together ownership groups. Maybe this is inevitable. In decades past, sporting events were analog affairs. Tickets were printed and sold, sponsors were asked to pay for signs in stadiums and fans turned on their televisions on Sunday afternoons to see their teams play. As the price of sports franchises has skyrocketed, so too have the challenges of running them. Owners these days need to be familiar with concepts like streaming, mobile ticketing and virtual reality, or at least have smart people around them, to understand how the league can continue growing. And to get an adequate return on their huge investments, they need to look for ways to wring money out of their franchises in increasingly complex and controversial ways, like ripping teams out of their communities and taking them to more profitable locations. Yet in varying ways, the departed owners made an imprint on the financial and social behemoth that the N.F.L. has become. Richardson and McNair did more than just bring teams to the Carolinas and to Houston (which lost its Oilers to Tennessee before the Texans were assembled as an expansion team). They were heavyweights in a group that included more than its share of powerful men. McNair was the chairman of the influential finance committee, and Richardson was the only owner to have played in the N.F.L. As veteran owners, they were trusted confidants of Commissioner Roger Goodell. Both played key roles in helping the N.F.L. return to Los Angeles, and at various times were on the compensation committee, which determines how much the commissioner and other top league executives were paid. Benson, an accountant by trade, was another stalwart on the finance committee. Each went about his business differently. McNair rarely shied away from a reporter\u2019s notebook or microphone, using folksy language that was both blunt and charming. Richardson avoided the media spotlight, but spoke with conviction in smaller settings. Allen almost never attended league meetings, but when he did, everyone took note, such as the time he flew to a special session in Houston in 2016 and threw his weight behind the Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who had ambitious plans to build a stadium in Los Angeles. Some of the changes have been subtle. Spanos\u2019s son, Dean, has run the Chargers for years. Gayle Benson, Tom\u2019s widow, has grabbed the reins of the Saints. McNair\u2019s son, Cal, is the Texans\u2019 chairman and chief operating officer, and likely to stay atop the franchise. Allen\u2019s sister, Jody, is in charge of the Seahawks, at least for now. In other ways, real turnover is afoot. Richardson\u2019s departure, amid a league investigation into the accusations against him, reflected a changing environment. So did his replacement. He sold to David Tepper, a hedge fund mogul.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/sports/nfl-owners-deaths.html"},

Global warming threatens American lives, cities and jobs, according to a major report by 13 federal agencies, unless the U.S. takes significant steps to rein it in. At the report\u2019s heart: Predictions are coming true \u2014 record wildfires, increasing floods, disrupted supply chains \u2014 and it could get much worse. Fire season could spread to the Southeast, crop failures could desolate the Midwest and cascading disasters could knock 10 percent off the U.S. economy by 2100. The findings in the report are directly at odds with President Trump\u2019s agenda of environmental deregulation, which he argues will spur economic growth. Here are five key takeaways. The report cited California\u2019s recent wildfire seasons as a case of worsening effects: Droughts create fire conditions, fires grow more destructive, smoke spreads and the authorities can never rest. Our reporters traveled to Northern California, where the survivors of the Camp Fire, burning in the town of Paradise, above, found reasons to be grateful on Thanksgiving; and to Southern California, where fires incinerated movie sets and hiking trails near Malibu.  Here\u2019s the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles. ____ 2. Chief Justice John Roberts rebuked President Trump, ending years of studied restraint in the face of the president\u2019s attacks on the judiciary. In response to Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of a ruling he did not like \u2014 he said \u201can Obama judge\u201d was to blame \u2014 Chief Justice Roberts, above, defended judges\u2019 independence. \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d he said. It may be a turning point: Since the arrival of two Trump appointees to the court, Chief Justice Roberts has moved to its center, a change that gives him extraordinary power and may have helped spur the statement. Leading conservatives offered measured support for the chief justice, though they praised the transformation of the courts engineered by the White House counsel, Don McGahn. That same counsel, now departed, rebuffed the president\u2019s desire to use the Justice Department to prosecute two political adversaries: Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent, and James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. ____ 3. A federal judge blocked President Trump\u2019s proclamation that banned migrants from applying for asylum anywhere but a port of entry. The temporary restraining order means the Trump administration must resume accepting asylum claims from migrants, no matter where or how they entered the U.S., at least until the case is decided. Mr. Trump\u2019s order was part of his effort to clamp down on immigration, especially a caravan of migrants gathering at border cities. The president has sent active-duty soldiers to the border \u2014 though his defense secretary has kept their role limited \u2014 and in Tijuana, Mexico, above, many migrants are wrestling with whether to settle or move on. Leaders of the incoming Mexican government are in talks with American officials to allow migrants applying for asylum in the U.S. to remain in Mexico while they await a decision. On Saturday, Mr. Trump suggested on Twitter that it was as good as a done deal, but Mexican officials say no agreement has been reached, and any such plan could face immediate legal challenges. ____ 4. On Sunday, Britain obtained the approval of the other 27 European Union members on a formal divorce pact from the bloc. Prime Minister Theresa May, above, must still get approval for the Brexit deal from an unhappy British Parliament. It\u2019s a compromise that no one seems to like. ____ 5. Black Friday was not so wild this year, but retailers and analysts said it got the shopping season off to a strong start. We rounded up the day across the globe, including a cheat sheet of what to buy and a return to F.A.O. Schwarz, the toy seller that has reopened under new management. But the good cheer about the economy may not last. The stock markets are a mess \u2014 with the year\u2019s gains erased by a sell-off this week \u2014 which our columnist sees as a warning sign of trouble. ____ 6. The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is forcing nations to pick sides, raising tensions around the world over territory, trade and influence. The U.S. has tried to rally Southeast Asian nations against China\u2019s military buildup, and pushed Europe on the issue of foreign investment. China has made inroads in Canada and presented itself as a leading lender for smaller nations. The power struggle threatens to disrupt the Group of 20 summit meeting on Friday in Argentina, which Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping are expected to attend. And in a special series, we looked at how China has defied expectations for decades, what \u201cMade in China\u201d means now, and how China remade the American dream in its image. Today we consider how the country controls its citizens. ____ 7. Rebuffing the C.I.A., President Trump sided with Saudi Arabia over the agency\u2019s conclusion that the kingdom\u2019s crown prince was responsible for the killing of a dissident journalist. In an extraordinary statement, Mr. Trump described a \u201cvery dangerous\u201d world, where transactional relationships rule the day. He suggested that it did not matter to him whether Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, above, knew of the murder of the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. \u201cMaybe he did,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cand maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d The C.I.A.\u2019s leaders, he later said, only had \u201cfeelings.\u201d Before Prince Mohammed was implicated in the murder, U.S. intelligence agencies were trying to solve another mystery: whether he was negotiating a nuclear deal with the U.S. with the goal of building an atomic bomb. ____ 8. Facebook took responsibility for hiring a lobbying group that pushed negative stories about its critics, including the philanthropist George Soros. The company released the memo on the eve of Thanksgiving, days after Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, said that she had no idea it had hired the lobby group, Definers. In the memo, she acknowledged that the group\u2019s work had crossed her desk. We took a look at how the firm brought \u201cdirty P.R.\u201d to Silicon Valley. And far from the social media giants of Northern California, engineers and social workers are trying a different kind of tech experiment, above: Zora, a robot caregiver for the elderly in France. ____ 9. Old dogs really do have trouble learning new tricks, imperiling the careers of canines on drug duty in the 10 states that have legalized recreational marijuana. New laws and recent court rulings have forced many police dogs into early retirement, and police departments are training new ones not to detect marijuana. Already, communities are fund-raising for new recruits \u2014 it costs thousands to buy and train a working dog \u2014 and the police are preparing their dogs for new lives. \u201cThey\u2019re our kids,\u201d one officer said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re done working, we\u2019re going to make sure they\u2019re really well taken care of.\u201d ____ 10. Finally, check out our Best Weekend Reads. This week, we hear an oral history of Barry Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMedicine for Melancholy\u201d from its admirers; watch the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade through the decades; and learn what drove a young American to a remote island, above, that has long been dangerous for outsiders. And here\u2019s the Week in Good News, including a resurgence of chess in Norway. For more suggestions on what to watch and listen to, may we suggest the latest small-screen recommendations from Watching and our music critics\u2019 latest playlist. Have a great week.

{"title": "Opinion | Everything Is for Sale Now. Even Us. ", "description": "The constant pressure to sell ourselves on every possible platform has produced its own brand of modern anxiety.", "author": "By Ruth Whippman", "content": "There is something about the consumer madness of the holiday season that makes me think of my friend Rebecca\u2019s mother. When I was in middle school, she had a side hustle selling acrylic-rhinestone bug brooches. The jewelry was hard to move on its merits \u2014 even for the 1980s it was staggeringly ugly. But what she lacked in salable product, she made up for in sheer selling stamina. Every sleepover, school fair or birthday party, out would come the tray of bejeweled grasshoppers and stag beetles, glinting with Reagan-era menace.  Presumably someone was making money from this venture \u2014 some proto-Trump barking orders from his tax haven \u2014 but it certainly didn\u2019t seem to be Rebecca\u2019s mother, whose sales pitches took on an ever more shrill note of desperation. Soon she had given up even the basic social pretense that we might actually want the brooches. The laws of supply and demand morphed seamlessly into the laws of guilt and obligation, and then into the laws of outright malice, mirroring the trajectory of capitalism itself. At that time, when naked hawking to your friends was still considered an etiquette blunder, the sales pitches by Rebecca\u2019s mother felt embarrassing \u2014 as gaudy and threatening to the social ecosystem as a purple rhinestone daddy longlegs. But 30 years later, at the height of the gig economy, when the foundation of working life has apparently become selling your friends things they don\u2019t want, I look back to that raw need in Rebecca\u2019s mother\u2019s eyes with something terrifyingly approaching recognition. As a writer, I am part of the 35 percent of the American work force that now works freelance in some capacity, either as a main source of income or as some kind of side hustle. This number is growing constantly \u2014 94 percent of the new jobs created in the last decade or so were freelance or contract-based.  When we think \u201cgig economy,\u201d we tend to picture an Uber driver or a TaskRabbit tasker rather than a lawyer or a doctor, but in reality, this scrappy economic model \u2014 grubbing around for work, all big dreams and bad health insurance \u2014 will soon catch up with the bulk of America\u2019s middle class. Major companies now outsource many of even their most skilled jobs, ditching their in-house lawyers and I.T. support teams in favor of on-demand contractors, paid by the hour. More than 18 million Americans are now involved in some kind of direct sales or multilevel marketing scheme, shelling out hundreds of dollars on vitamins or juicers or leggings, then frantically attempting to recoup the money by flogging them to friends and neighbors. Economists predict that by 2027, gig workers of varying descriptions will make up more than half of the work force. An estimated 47 percent of millennials already work in this way. It certainly feels familiar. Almost everyone I know now has some kind of hustle, whether job, hobby, or side or vanity project. Share my blog post, buy my book, click on my link, follow me on Instagram, visit my Etsy shop, donate to my Kickstarter, crowdfund my heart surgery. It\u2019s as though we are all working in Walmart on an endless Black Friday of the soul. Being sold to can be socially awkward, for sure, but when it comes to corrosive self-doubt, being the seller is a thousand times worse. The constant curation of a salable self demanded by the new economy can be a special hellspring of anxiety. Like many modern workers, I find that only a small percentage of my job is now actually doing my job. The rest is performing a million acts of unpaid micro-labor that can easily add up to a full-time job in itself. Tweeting and sharing and schmoozing and blogging. Liking and commenting on others\u2019 tweets and shares and schmoozes and blogs. Ambivalently \u201cmaintaining a presence on social media,\u201d attempting to sell a semi-fictional, much more appealing version of myself in the vain hope that this might somehow help me sell some actual stuff at some unspecified future time. The trick of doing this well, of course, is to act as if you aren\u2019t doing it at all \u2014 as if this is simply how you like to unwind in the evening, by sharing your views on pasta sauce with your 567,000 followers. Seeing the slick charm of successful online \u201cinfluencers\u201d spurs me to download e-courses on how to \u201ccrack Instagram\u201d or \u201cdevelop my personal brand story.\u201d But as soon as I hand over my credit card details, I am flooded with vague self-disgust. I instantly abandon the courses and revert to my usual business model \u2014 badgering and guilting my friends across a range of online platforms, employing the personal brand story of \u201cpleeeeeeeeeeaassssee.\u201d As my friend Helena (Buy her young adult novel! Available on Amazon!) puts it, buying, promoting or sharing your friend\u2019s \u201cthing\u201d is now a tax payable for modern friendship. But this expectation becomes its own monster. I find myself auditing my friends\u2019 loyalty based on their efforts. Who bought it? Who shared it on Facebook? Was it a share from the heart, or a \u201cduty share\u201d \u2014 with that telltale, torturous phrasing that squeaks past the minimum social requirement but deftly dissociates the sharer from the product: \u201cMy friend wrote a book \u2014 I haven\u2019t read it, but maybe you should.\u201d In this cutthroat human marketplace, we are worth only as much as the sum of our metrics, so checking those metrics can become obsessive. What\u2019s my Amazon ranking? How many likes? How many retweets? How many followers? (The word \u201cfollowers\u201d is in itself a clear indicator of something psychologically unhealthy going on \u2014 the standard term for the people we now spend the bulk of our time with sounds less like a functioning human relationship than the P.R. materials of the Branch Davidians.) Of course a fair chunk of this mass selling frenzy is motivated by money. With a collapsing middle class, as well as close to zero job security and none of the benefits associated with it, self-marketing has become, for many, a necessity in order to eat. But what\u2019s more peculiar is just how imperfectly all this correlates with financial need or even greed. The sad truth is that many of us would probably make more money stacking shelves or working at the drive-through than selling our \u201cthing.\u201d The real prize is deeper, more existential. What this is really about, for many of us, is a roaring black hole of psychological need. After a couple of decades of constant advice to \u201cfollow our passions\u201d and \u201clive our dreams,\u201d for a certain type of relatively privileged modern freelancer, nothing less than total self-actualization at work now seems enough. But this leaves us with an angsty mismatch between personal expectation and economic reality. So we shackle our self-worth to the success of these projects \u2014 the book or blog post or range of crocheted stuffed penguins becomes a proxy for our very soul. In the new economy you can be your own boss and your own ugly bug brooch. Kudos to whichever neoliberal masterminds came up with this system. They sell this infinitely seductive torture to us as \u201cflexible working\u201d or \u201cbeing the C.E.O. of You!\u201d and we jump at it, salivating, because on its best days, the freelance life really can be all of that.  But as long as we are happy to be paid for our labor in psychological rather than financial rewards, those at the top are delighted to comply. While we grub and scrabble and claw at one another chasing these tiny pellets of self-esteem, the bug-brooch barons still pocket the actual cash.  This is the future, and research suggests that it\u2019s a rat race that is already taking a severe toll on our psyches. A 2017 study suggests that this trend toward increasingly market-driven human interaction is making us paranoid, jittery, self-critical and judgmental. Analyzing data from the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale from 1989 to 2016, the study\u2019s authors found a surprisingly large increase over this period in three distinct types of perfectionism: \u201cSelf-orientated,\u201d whereby we hold ourselves to increasingly unrealistic standards and judge ourselves harshly when we fail to meet them; \u201csocially prescribed,\u201d in which we are convinced that other people judge us harshly; and \u201cother-orientated,\u201d in which we get our revenge by judging them just as harshly. These elements of perfectionism positively correlate with mental health problems, including anxiety, depression and even suicide, which are also on the rise. The authors describe this new-normal mind-set as a \u201csense of self overwhelmed by pathological worry and a fear of negative social evaluation.\u201d Hmm. Maybe I should make that my personal brand story.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/gig-economy-self-promotion-anxiety.html"},
{"title": "Opinion | What an Italian Donkey\u2019s Fate Tells Us About the Future of Europe", "description": "A fable about Italy, bond yields and politics in the European Union.", "author": "By Lucia Rubinelli", "content": "In the summer of 2012, in the small town of San Zeno di Montagna in northern Italy, my grandfather welcomed a new addition to the family: One of his donkeys gave birth to a female foal, which he kept as a pet. Much to our amusement, he decided to call it Angela Spread. Angela, of course, was Angela Merkel, whose rigid approach to Europe\u2019s fiscal crisis had become particularly infamous over the previous year. \u201cSpread\u201d referred to a somewhat obscure term in bond finance: the difference between the yields of Italian and German government bonds.  When asked about the little donkey\u2019s peculiar name, he answered that it would help us all to laugh a little about Italy\u2019s troubled economy and years of instability. \u201cLo spread\u201d had become shorthand for everything that was wrong. The yield on a bond reflects how much interest a borrower \u2014 in this case, the government \u2014 has to pay to borrow money. Germany, with its booming economy, is considered an excellent credit risk. So its bond yields are very low. Italy, by comparison, is seen as an overspender, so its yields are much higher. The difference is, in effect, encapsulated by that one number, \u201clo spread,\u201d an object of respect and fear that tells us a lot about the messy state of European politics. Silvio Berlusconi, Italy\u2019s former prime minister, was the first supposed victim of lo spread. In 2011, the European Central Bank pressured him to reduce Italy\u2019s deficit, but he refused to rein in spending. In November, the spread reached a high of 574 points, indicating that Italian bonds yielded 5.74 percentage points more than German bonds. The same month, Mr. Berlusconi resigned, making way for a technocratic government led by Mario Monti, an economist. \u201cLo spread\u201d soon took center stage not only in politics but also in everyday life. I saw it in graffiti condemning the European Central Bank. On a trip to the Dolomites, I heard it in casual conversations at the bar. \u201cLo spread\u201d even made it to pop music, including a song called \u201cIl ballo dello spread,\u201d or \u201cThe Dance of the Spread.\u201d The chorus says it all: \u201cWhile lo spread goes up, up, up, Italian citizens go down, down, down.\u201d You\u2019re supposed to dance to it by mimicking the oscillations of the spread. These various attempts to desacralize \u201clo spread,\u201d to make fun of it and demystify it, served partly to make sense of its sudden and inescapable presence on the scene of Italian politics and partly to blame Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s government for getting us there in the first place. The spread reigned sovereign. It was constantly scrutinized and regularly on the front page of Italian newspapers. The government approved or rejected policies depending on its movements. Lo spread seemed to have the final word on Italy\u2019s future. In 2013, when Italy\u2019s economic situation began to stabilize, the phantom of the spread retreated. It reappeared in March, when a new coalition government came to power \u2014 one elected on an anti-austerity, euroskeptic agenda. The gap between Italian and German bond yields again started to grow, and with it, the spread made its reappearance in the headlines. Last month, the European Commission, for the first time in its history, rejected the Italian government\u2019s budget, primarily because proposed spending on tax cuts, pension benefits and unemployment relief caused Italy to exceed E.U. debt guidelines. The E.U. has threatened to fine Italy, but the government has announced that it will not back down. The tensions caused the spread to reach its highest levels in nearly five years. But something changed. \u201cLo spread\u201d does not seem to command the same devotion it once did. The government dismisses it by either ridiculing or demonizing it. Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement and a deputy prime minister, claimed that its rise is a result of manipulation by opposition parties, while others have blamed an international conspiracy orchestrated by global finance and European technocrats. Matteo Salvini, leader of the League political party and the other deputy prime minister, quipped that \u201clo spread\u201d is best eaten with bread over breakfast. In other words, Italy\u2019s leaders have discovered what so many Italians realized long ago: Mockery is a powerful tool, particularly when applied to the European Union\u2019s rigid rules. Apocalyptic predictions about what would happen if \u201clo spread\u201d became too large have not come to pass, at least for now. The government no longer accepts an abstract bond finance term as the unappealable judge of Italian politics, and there is a widespread sense that it is time to challenge not just the commission\u2019s fiscal rules but also the E.U. in general. Instead of a symbol of Italy\u2019s weakness relative to Germany and the rest of Europe, \u201clo spread\u201d has become a symbol of all that is frustrating about the E.U. My grandpa figured this out a while ago. When Angela Spread was fully grown, he sold her.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/italy-europe-bond-spread.html"},
{"title": "Opinion | Lean Out ", "description": "Perhaps it\u2019s only fair that, as women like Sheryl Sandberg rise to power, they pay the price for failure. But why is everyone so ready to forgive the man who really runs Facebook?", "author": "By Kara Swisher", "content": "Suddenly, everyone wants Sheryl Sandberg to lean out. Apologies for using that obvious turn of phrase to describe the precarious situation the chief operating officer of Facebook now finds herself in. But it works perfectly for Ms. Sandberg, the author of \u201cLean In,\u201d which made her very famous and helped burnish her reputation as a management wizard. Now she finds herself facing intense criticism for how she and the company handled the Cambridge Analytica scandal, account hacks, Russians running wild over its platform and the hiring of a communications firm called Definers Public Affairs (which really sounds like something a bunch of toxic bros would come up with after too many beer bongs down at Faber College\u2019s Omega Theta Pi) to slime various and sundry detractors. Many are even calling for her to be pushed out of the company.  To be clear, as the No. 2 in charge, Ms. Sandberg deserves much blame for the bad decisions at Facebook. But it\u2019s notable that she is under much more fire than Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive. While he underwent some scrutiny at Congressional hearings and in interviews, he has somehow managed to come off like a geek who has lost his way in the woods. Whatever blame he got has dissipated quickly. Ms. Sandberg dodged many of the Facebook controversies this year. But no longer. A recent New York Times article that laid bare the last months at the company began with the line: \u201cSheryl Sandberg was seething,\u201d and went on to show her yelling at the company\u2019s security chief, Alex Stamos, trying to slow roll the utterance of the word \u201cRussia\u201d in a report and alternately sweet-talking and strong-arming lawmakers to Facebook\u2019s will. And this week, in news dropped on the day before Thanksgiving, Ms. Sandberg admitted she did know a thing or two about the hiring of the Definers, after previously saying that she did not. One of her lieutenants, Elliot Schrage, wrote a post in which he admitted \u2014 as everyone who knows him and the company already assumed \u2014 that he was the one who hired and directed the firm. But Ms. Sandberg somehow looked even worse in an addendum. \u201cSome of their work was incorporated into materials presented to me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand I received a small number of emails where Definers was referenced.\u201d Whoops. And so now come the calls for her comeuppance, which have been growing louder. Ms. Sandberg is especially vulnerable because she has long been cast as the professional \u2014 who came from Google no less \u2014 in contrast to \u201cZuck,\u201d the founder, the dude whom no one thought had the people skills or altruistic motives to deal with these high stakes political decisions. And yet he is the one with the power at Facebook. He is its top executive, its visionary founder and, most of all, its controlling shareholder. Mr. Zuckerberg, if you want to use a comic-book reference here, is a combination of Wolverine and Deadpool with a little bit of zombie magic thrown in. Mr. Schrage, the one who actually made the bad call on the press strategy, is also somehow evading censure: He is now seen as the loyal guy who fell on his sword, while Ms. Sandberg looks more like the one who pushed him onto the blade. And that is one of the key lessons to learn here about the tech industry today: Everyone expects so little from the male leaders who are often seen as the fulcrum of the digital worlds they create, while the female leaders \u2014 who are not usually the inventors \u2014 are held to a tougher line. Ms. Sandberg, of course, has power over much of Facebook\u2019s business operations, advertising and also the critical communications and policy units. Perhaps it\u2019s only fair that, as women rise to power, they pay the price for failure. But what is more often true in tech is that men are seen as the key players, and women are just not seen as crucial to a company's success. That inequity has become a theme of a wide range of employment issues across Silicon Valley of late, including the phenomenon of \u201cunderleveling\u201d \u2014 hiring women and people of color at a lower level than they deserve. In a podcast I did this week with six of the organizers of the Google walkout to protest sexual harassment policies and pay inequity, one of them, Stephanie Parker, described her situation compared to similarly qualified men. \u201cI, as a black woman at Google, came in with an undergraduate and master\u2019s degree from Stanford and three years\u2019 worth of experience working in the tech industry, and they chose to put me into an entry-level six-month contract position in recruiting,\u201d she said. She said Google managers insist that the company isn\u2019t diverse enough because of the \u201cpipeline problem.\u201d They say: \u201cWe need to go to more schools and teach them how to code. There\u2019s something wrong with these students and something wrong with the pipeline.\u201d But she argued there\u2019s a bigger problem at Google that has nothing to do with the pipeline. \u201cBlack women have the highest attrition rate. They\u2019re leaving Google at higher rates than any other group, all over the industry.\u201d She and the other organizers blamed this on opportunities that were not offered as readily, on tougher hurdles to leap over, on pay that was consistently lower and, most of all, on a system that forgave the men for their mistakes, and did not forgive the women. That was underscored at Google by an astonishing $90 million payout to the top executive Andy Rubin when he left in a cloud of controversy. Ms. Parker, who now works at YouTube, described succinctly the issue of who really paid the price for his sins. At the walkout, she said she asked the crowd: \u201cWhere do you think Google got that $90 million they used to pay out Andy Rubin? They got it from every time you worked late. Every promotion you didn\u2019t get because they said there\u2019s not enough budget, you have to wait. It\u2019s from every contractor who came to work sick because they have no paid time off. These are conscious decisions that the company is making, and abusers are getting rich off of our hard work. It\u2019s just not fair, and they completely know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d They completely do. Ms. Sandberg is hardly blameless, but notice that she is the one facing the real firing line and not Mr. Zuckerberg. Which is to say, no matter his responsibility, he is unkillable, unfireable and untouchable and no amount of leaning in by Ms. Sandberg or any other woman in tech is going to change that.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sheryl-sandberg-mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html"},
{"title": "Opinion | The New Radicalization of the Internet", "description": "Jihadists and right-wing extremists use remarkably similar social media strategies. ", "author": "By The Editorial Board", "content": "Social media has played a key role in the recent rise of violent right-wing extremism in the United States, including three recent incidents \u2014 one in which a man was accused of sending mail bombs to critics of the president, another in which a man shot dead two African-Americans in a Kroger\u2019s grocery store in Kentucky, and a third in which a man is accused of conducting a murderous rampage at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.  Each of these attacks falls under the definition of right-wing extremism by the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland: \u201cviolence in support of the belief that personal and/or national way of life is under attack and is either already lost or that the threat is imminent.\" Antiglobalism, racial or ethnic supremacy, nationalism, suspicion of the federal government, obsessions over individual liberty \u2014 these are all hallmarks of this network of ideologies, which is, of course, shot through with conspiracy theories. Yet, even as the body count of this fanaticism grows, the nation still lacks a coherent strategy for countering the violent extremism made possible through the internet.  Instead, the fundamental design of social media sometimes exacerbates the problem. It rewards loyalty to one\u2019s own group, providing a dopamine rush of engagement that fuels platforms like Facebook and YouTube, as well as more obscure sites like Gab or Voat. The algorithms that underpin these networks also promote engaging content, in a feedback loop that, link by link, guides new audiences to toxic ideas.  This dynamic plays out around the globe. In Germany, one study showed that towns with heavier Facebook usage saw more anti-refugee attacks. In Sri Lanka and Myanmar, Facebook played a significant role in inciting violence.  While the motivations of violent actors may be different, the paths they travel toward violence are similar. Cesar Sayoc, the accused mail bomber, posted links on Twitter and Facebook to conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and illegal immigration. The accused Pittsburgh killer, Robert Bowers, was active on Gab, a social network established to harbor speech censored by mainstream platforms \u2014 including speech that many other platforms found too extremist. Two hours before the shooting, Mr. Bowers posted that a Jewish organization that aids refugees \u201clikes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can\u2019t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I\u2019m going in.\u201d Gregory Bush \u2014 the man accused of shooting the two people in a Kroger\u2019s and saying, when confronted by a white man, \u201cWhites don\u2019t kill whites\u201d \u2014 was a more passive consumer of social media. But his most recent likes on Facebook skewed heavily to conservative media, and a longtime online acquaintance said that Mr. Bush\u2019s tweets \u2014 which had long been peppered with infrequent casual racism \u2014 became more and more vitriolic over the course of the 2016 election. There was no organization behind these attacks. The three suspects most likely never met or interacted with one another. This is the new shape of extremism: self-directed, internet-inflamed terrorists.  Radicalization might start with casual conversations among video gamers. What begins with a few racist slurs may lead to exposure to overt white supremacist propaganda. A seemingly innocuous YouTube channel may recommend other, more inflammatory channels, which in turn may recommend ever more extremist content \u2014 a network identified by the Data & Society Research Institute as the Alternative Influence Network. We already know how dangerous this cycle of radicalization can be, because similar mechanisms have fed Islamist terrorism in recent years. Anwar al-Awlaki, the cleric who communicated with the 2009 Fort Hood shooter and coached a young man to try to blow up an airliner over Detroit, left a digital footprint that survived on YouTube for years after his assassination by an American drone strike in Yemen. Videos of his sermons, even anodyne history lectures or self-help coaching, were always popular, thanks to his pleasant voice and serious demeanor.\u00a0Now they also have a martyr\u2019s allure. If a viewer clicked on the cleric\u2019s earlier, gentler, talks, YouTube\u2019s algorithms would point the viewer to one of his later sermons, like one describing why it\u2019s a Muslim\u2019s duty to kill Americans. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the two Boston Marathon bombers, tweeted approvingly about Mr. Awlaki\u2019s lectures. Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi, one of shooters who killed 12 people at the Paris offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015, name-dropped Mr. Awlaki in a phone interview with a reporter before being shot by police. In death, as in life, Anwar al-Awlaki\u2019s words inspired lonely, disturbed, or disaffected young men to kill. By 2017, YouTube began to rethink its policies, and now all of Mr. Awlaki\u2019s material \u2014 unless presented as news commentary or in a critical context \u2014 is banned from the platform. Facebook has long banned all of Mr. Awlaki\u2019s videos. Both avow a commitment to combat hate speech, extremism and misinformation. But platforms have been more tentative in dealing with the kind of right-wing extremism that focuses on white supremacy. Although organizations like the Anti-Defamation League and the Center for Strategic and International Studies provide information about these groups, official government sources are still crucial if there is to be an effective crackdown. Vast federal resources, for example, went into identifying the networks around Mr. Awlaki, who has been on a designated terrorist list since 2010.  But the government does not officially designate domestic terrorist organizations. The Trump administration has reduced or eliminated modest programs begun under President Barack Obama to counter violent extremism and deter recruitment, including among white supremacists. Mr. Trump has focused on Islamic extremism to the exclusion of other threats. Federal agencies do not even have common definitions of \u201cdomestic terrorist\u201d and \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d Tech companies often draw on government lists to police their platforms for violent extremism. YouTube, for example, has long prohibited designated terrorists from having their own channels. For years, Facebook has banned the praise or support of organizations deemed dangerous or violent \u2014 a list at least partly informed by governments. (Facebook claims that it does not heavily rely on government lists.) Both platforms, along with Twitter and other technology companies, use a shared database of terrorist content \u2014 coordinated through the nonprofit Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism \u2014 to help take down extremist content faster. What the forum is capable of identifying is informed by what kind of information official organizations have about extremism.   While international terrorism has been the target of considerable attention and national resources, the threat from domestic terrorism has grown. Domestic terrorist attacks have been on the rise since 2008, and in 2017 alone there was a 57 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents.  Past decades saw violence by left-wing groups, environmental extremists and black nationalists, but while attacks from those groups have fallen dramatically, violence from the right has risen. Right-wing extremists in the United States, particularly white supremacists, have been responsible for the vast majority of at least 387 domestic terrorist murders in the last decade. Last year, 20 of the 34 terrorist murders in the United States were connected to right-wing extremism.  These are statistics compiled by the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, the most authoritative source for documenting the phenomenon, since the government doesn\u2019t even keep good track of the danger. During the Obama years, conservative media manufactured a controversy over a 2009 Department of Homeland Security report about right-wing extremism, claiming politicized oppression. Under pressure from Republican lawmakers, Janet Napolitano, then the homeland security secretary, rescinded the report, and her department rolled back its work on violent right-wing extremism. So the tech industry\u2019s failings are not its alone. (Of course, Facebook\u2019s dragging its heels and downplaying the extent of Russian influence on its platform does not give rise to optimism that the industry is doing its best.) The complex interplay of terrorism, propaganda and technology requires a concerted response by government and business. Private corporations should not be put in the position of trying to thwart extremism with help from only a handful of nonprofit groups.  Major platforms are applying machine learning and other techniques to remove noxious content, but what good is the most sophisticated artificial intelligence when the actual intelligence that feeds it is inadequate and skewed by biases in American society? These biases are reflected in government lists, in policy decisions by tech companies and in the enforcement of those policies by moderators. Yet it\u2019s quite clear that while the core philosophies of white supremacists and jihadists differ, their recruitment strategies and propaganda efforts are frequently similar. Will Fears, who was arrested at a Gainesville, Fla., rally in support of the alt-right personality Richard Spencer, compared himself to the Boston Marathon bombers, the Tsarnaev brothers, in an interview with The New York Times Magazine. \u201cMaybe he saw a lot of things in the world that bothered him and just didn\u2019t know how to deal with it,\u201d Mr. Fears said of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the young man who so loved Anwar al-Awlaki\u2019s lectures. \u201cI can sort of relate to that.\u201d ", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/facebook-twitter-terrorism-extremism.html"},
{"title": "Opinion | My New Vagina Won\u2019t Make Me Happy", "description": "And it shouldn\u2019t have to.", "author": "By Andrea Long Chu", "content": "Next Thursday, I will get a vagina. The procedure will last around six hours, and I will be in recovery for at least three months. Until the day I die, my body will regard the vagina as a wound; as a result, it will require regular, painful attention to maintain. This is what I want, but there is no guarantee it will make me happier. In fact, I don\u2019t expect it to. That shouldn\u2019t disqualify me from getting it. I like to say that being trans is the second-worst thing that ever happened to me. (The worst was being born a boy.) Dysphoria is notoriously difficult to describe to those who haven\u2019t experienced it, like a flavor. Its official definition \u2014 the distress some transgender people feel at the incongruence between the gender they express and the gender they\u2019ve been socially assigned \u2014 does little justice to the feeling. But in my experience, at least: Dysphoria feels like being unable to get warm, no matter how many layers you put on. It feels like hunger without appetite. It feels like getting on an airplane to fly home, only to realize mid-flight that this is it: You\u2019re going to spend the rest of your life on an airplane. It feels like grieving. It feels like having nothing to grieve.  Many conservatives call this crazy. A popular right-wing narrative holds that gender dysphoria is a clinical delusion; hence, feeding that delusion with hormones and surgeries constitutes a violation of medical ethics. Just ask the Heritage Foundation fellow Ryan T. Anderson, whose book \u201cWhen Harry Became Sally\u201d draws heavily on the work of Dr. Paul McHugh, the psychiatrist who shut down the gender identity clinic at Johns Hopkins in 1979 on the grounds that trans-affirmative care meant \u201ccooperating with a mental illness.\u201d Mr. Anderson writes, \u201cWe must avoid adding to the pain experienced by people with gender dysphoria, while we present them with alternatives to transitioning.\u201d In this view, it is not only fair to refuse trans people the care they seek; it is also kind. A therapist with a suicidal client does not draw the bath and supply the razor. Take it from my father, a pediatrician, who once remarked to me that he would no sooner prescribe puberty blockers to a gender dysphoric child than he would give a distemper shot to someone who believed she was a dog. Naturally, a liberal counternarrative exists, and it has become increasingly mainstream. Transgender people are not deluded, advocates say, but they are suffering; therefore, medical professionals have a duty to ease that suffering. In this view, dysphoria is more akin to a herniated disc \u2014 a source of debilitating but treatable pain. \u201cGender dysphoria can in large part be alleviated through treatment,\u201d states the World Professional Association for Transgender Health in its Standards of Care. Dr. John Steever, an adolescent medicine specialist at the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery in New York City, told The Times last month that a gender-affirming approach seeks to \u201cprevent some of the traditional horrible outcomes that transgender or gender-nonconforming youth have ended up with,\u201d including increased rates of depression, suicidal ideation and substance abuse. A gender-affirmative model will almost certainly lead to more and higher-quality care for transgender patients. But by focusing on minimizing patients\u2019 pain, it leaves the door open for care to be refused when a doctor, or someone playing doctor, deems the risks too high. This was the thrust of a recent Atlantic cover story in which the journalist Jesse Singal used the statistically small number of people who have come to regret their medical transitions to argue that transitioning is \u201cnot the answer for everyone.\u201d There was a dog whistle here: Hormones and surgery can and should be withheld from patients who want them when such treatments cannot be reasonably expected to \u201cmaximize good outcomes.\u201d Mr. Singal is Mr. Anderson\u2019s liberal doppelg\u00e4nger. Both writers engage in what we could call \u201ccompassion-mongering,\u201d peddling bigotry in the guise of sympathetic concern. Both posit a medical duty to refrain from increasing trans people\u2019s suffering \u2014 what\u2019s called nonmaleficence. Neither has any issue with gatekeeping per se; they differ, modestly, on how the gate is to be kept. Buried under all of this, like a sober tuber, lies an assumption so sensible you\u2019ll think me silly for digging it up. It\u2019s this: People transition because they think it will make them feel better. The thing is, this is wrong. I feel demonstrably worse since I started on hormones. One reason is that, absent the levies of the closet, years of repressed longing for the girlhood I never had have flooded my consciousness. I am a marshland of regret. Another reason is that I take estrogen \u2014 effectively, delayed-release sadness, a little aquamarine pill that more or less guarantees a good weep within six to eight hours. Like many of my trans friends, I\u2019ve watched my dysphoria balloon since I began transition. I now feel very strongly about the length of my index fingers \u2014 enough that I will sometimes shyly unthread my hand from my girlfriend\u2019s as we walk down the street. When she tells me I\u2019m beautiful, I resent it. I\u2019ve been outside. I know what beautiful looks like. Don\u2019t patronize me. I was not suicidal before hormones. Now I often am. I won\u2019t go through with it, probably. Killing is icky. I tell you this not because I\u2019m cruising for sympathy but to prepare you for what I\u2019m telling you now: I still want this, all of it. I want the tears; I want the pain. Transition doesn\u2019t have to make me happy for me to want it. Left to their own devices, people will rarely pursue what makes them feel good in the long term. Desire and happiness are independent agents. As long as transgender medicine retains the alleviation of pain as its benchmark of success, it will reserve for itself, with a dictator\u2019s benevolence, the right to withhold care from those who want it. Transgender people have been forced, for decades, to rely for care on a medical establishment that regards them with both suspicion and condescension. And yet as things stand today, there is still only one way to obtain hormones and surgery: to pretend that these treatments will make the pain go away. The medical maxim \u201cFirst, do no harm\u201d assumes that health care providers possess both the means and the authority to decide what counts as harm. When doctors and patients disagree, the exercise of this prerogative can, itself, be harmful. Nonmaleficence is a principle violated in its very observation. Its true purpose is not to shield patients from injury but to install the medical professional as a little king of someone else\u2019s body. Let me be clear: I believe that surgeries of all kinds can and do make an enormous difference in the lives of trans people.  But I also believe that surgery\u2019s only prerequisite should be a simple demonstration of want. Beyond this, no amount of pain, anticipated or continuing, justifies its withholding. Nothing, not even surgery, will grant me the mute simplicity of having always been a woman. I will live with this, or I won\u2019t. That\u2019s fine. The negative passions \u2014 grief, self-loathing, shame, regret \u2014 are as much a human right as universal health care, or food. There are no good outcomes in transition. There are only people, begging to be taken seriously.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/vaginoplasty-transgender-medicine.html"},
{"title": "Opinion | Do You Have a Moral Duty to Leave Facebook?", "description": "The platform has been used to disrupt elections, disseminate propaganda and promote hate. Regular users should ask if they are implicated in these failings.", "author": "By S. Matthew Liao", "content": "I joined Facebook in 2008, and for the most part, I have benefited from being on it. Lately, however, I have wondered whether I should delete my Facebook account. As a philosopher with a special interest in ethics, I am using \u201cshould\u201d in the moral sense. That is, in light of recent events implicating Facebook in objectionable behavior, is there a duty to leave it? In moral philosophy, it is common to draw a distinction between duties to oneself and duties to others. From a self-regarding perspective, there are numerous reasons one might have a duty to leave Facebook. For one thing, Facebook can be time-consuming and addictive, to no fruitful end. In addition, as researchers have demonstrated, Facebook use can worsen depression and anxiety. Someone who finds himself mindlessly and compulsively scrolling through Facebook, or who is constantly comparing himself unfavorably with his Facebook friends, might therefore have a duty of self-care to get off Facebook.  From the perspective of one\u2019s duties to others, the possibility of a duty to leave Facebook arises once one recognizes that Facebook has played a significant role in undermining democratic values around the world. For example, Facebook has been used to spread white supremacist propaganda and anti-Semitic messages in and outside the United States. The United Nations has blamed Facebook for the dissemination of hate speech against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar that resulted in their ethnic cleansing.  Facebook also enabled the political data firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest the personal information of millions of voters in the United States so they could be targeted with personalized political advertisements. A significant amount of fake news can be found on Facebook, and for many users, Facebook has become a large echo chamber, where people merely seek out information that reinforces their views. Some people might think that because they mostly share photos of their cats on Facebook, such concerns do not apply to them. But this is not so, for three reasons. First, even if one does not contribute directly to the dissemination of fake news or hang out in echo chambers, simply being on Facebook encourages one\u2019s friends to stay on Facebook, and some of those friends might engage in such activities. This influence on others is known as a (positive) network effect, where increased numbers of people improve the value of a product. Second, by being on Facebook one serves as a data point for Facebook\u2019s social media experiment, even if one encounters none of Facebook\u2019s experimental manipulations. In doing so, one could be helping Facebook to refine its algorithms so that it can better single out specific individuals for certain purposes, some of which could be as nefarious as those of Cambridge Analytica. Consider an analogy. When testing the safety and efficacy of new drugs, subjects are randomly assigned either to an experimental group or a control group, and only subjects in the experimental group receive the new drug. Nevertheless, the subjects in the control group are essential to the experiment. Third, using Facebook is not just an individual action but also a collective one that may be akin to failing to pay taxes. A few people failing to pay taxes might not make much of a difference to a government\u2019s budget, but such an action may nevertheless be wrong because it is a failure to participate in a collective action that achieves a certain good end. In a similar vein, choosing to remain on Facebook might not directly undermine democratic values. But such an action could also be wrong because we might be failing to participate in a collective action (that is, leaving Facebook) that would prevent the deterioration of democracy. So do we have an obligation to leave Facebook for others\u2019 sake? The answer is a resounding yes for those who are intentionally spreading hate speech and fake news on Facebook. For those of us who do not engage in such objectionable behavior, it is helpful to consider whether Facebook has crossed certain moral \u201cred lines,\u201d entering the realm of outright wickedness. For me at least, Facebook would have crossed a moral red line if it had, for example, intentionally sold the data of its users to Cambridge Analytica with the full knowledge that company would use the data subversively to influence a democratic election. Likewise, Facebook would have crossed a red line if it had intentionally assisted in the dissemination of hate speech in Myanmar. But the evidence indicates that Facebook did not intend for those things to occur on its platform. The fact that those things did occur, however, means that Facebook needs to be much more proactive in fixing such problems. Will it? The recent worrisome revelation that Facebook hired an opposition-research firm that attempted to discredit protesters by claiming that they were agents of the financier George Soros is not encouraging. While there still appears to be some daylight between Facebook and what is being done on its platform or in its name, darkness is crowding in. That said, we should not place the responsibility to uphold democratic values entirely on Facebook. As moral agents, we should also hold ourselves responsible for our conduct, and we should be reflective about what we say, react to and share when we are on social media. Among Twitter users, a common refrain is \u201cretweets are not endorsements.\u201d In a similar manner, one might also think that \u201csharing\u201d or \u201creacting to\u201d are not \u201cendorsements.\u201d This is a mistake. By sharing or reacting to a post, even if one explicitly criticizes the post, one is amplifying the message of that post and signaling that the post warrants further attention. For now I\u2019m going to stay on Facebook. But if new information suggests that Facebook has crossed a moral red line, we will all have an obligation to opt out.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/facebook-immoral.html"},
{"title": "Opinion | The Woman Who Still Finds Louis C.K. Lovable ", "description": "The French comedian Blanche Gardin is taking on all of feminism\u2019s orthodoxies. ", "author": "By Pamela Druckerman", "content": "PARIS \u2014 In May 2017, the comedian Blanche Gardin appeared onstage at the Moli\u00e8res, the awards show for French theater, and said that when it comes to directors who are accused of sexual violence, \u201cYou have to know how to separate the man from the artist.\u201d \u201cStill,\u201d she added innocently, \u201cIt\u2019s funny that this separation applies only to artists. For example, no one says about the baker, \u2018Yes, O.K., it\u2019s true, he rapes kids in the bakehouse, but come on, he makes an extraordinary baguette.\u201d That segment went viral in France. When the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke five months later, Ms. Gardin seemed poised to become France\u2019s new feminist hero. But then in March she appeared at the C\u00e9sar Awards \u2014 France\u2019s version of the Oscars \u2014 wearing a button with a photo of Louis C.K., the American comedian who\u2019d recently acknowledged asking female colleagues to watch him masturbate. The two are now reportedly dating. Ms. Gardin has recently risen to fame in France by provocatively calling attention to problems faced by women, and then refusing to follow the feminist party line on how to solve them. The controversy she has generated helps explain the ambivalent French response to the #MeToo movement, and how they view relations between women and men. \u201cWe should rejoice \u2014 from now on it\u2019s clear for everyone that producers no longer have the right to rape actresses,\u201d Ms. Gardin told an audience of French luminaries at the C\u00e9sars. \u201cBut there\u2019s something that isn\u2019t clear, and that we need to clarify quickly: Do we still have the right to have sex in exchange for roles? Because if we can\u2019t do that anymore, we\u2019ll have to learn lines and go to casting calls, and frankly we don\u2019t have time.\u201d Ms. Gardin, 41, grew up in a tony suburb of Paris, the daughter of well-off leftists (she jokes that she used to march past her housekeeper chanting denunciations of the bourgeoisie). As a teenager, she suffered from depression and ran away from home. She eventually returned and got a degree in sociology. She worked with children and, on the side, made comedy videos with friends. In her early 30s, when she was hospitalized after a breakup, a psychiatrist suggested that she write about her own life. Around the same time, Ms. Gardin began watching videos of Louis C.K. on stage. French humorists then still mostly performed as characters or did sketches mocking others. It was closer to theater or satire than to American-style stand-up. Ms. Gardin was struck by how Louis C.K. simply stood at the microphone and described his own life, flaws and all. \u201cIt was Louis C.K. and the psychiatric hospital\u201d that saved me, she later explained. By 2014, Ms. Gardin was doing a one-woman show in a small theater on a barge on the Seine. Wearing belted A-line dresses and red nail polish and matching lipstick, she bracingly described her romantic failures and her feeling of being desperately alone. When I first interviewed her and saw her perform back then, she wondered offstage whether her act was too melancholy to be entertaining. \u201cIt took me a long time to be funny,\u201d she told a magazine.  Louis C.K. remained hugely influential. \u201cI am obsessed with Louis C.K., his series and shows,\u201d she told another interviewer. \u201cI\u2019ve watched everything eight or nine times. He\u2019s a monster of sincerity.\u201d  Her own audience was growing. A subsequent show was picked up by Netflix. Parisians \u2014 who typically confine private feelings to a \u201csecret garden\u201d \u2014 were fascinated by Ms. Gardin\u2019s self-deprecating, stream-of-consciousness style, in which she seemed to be confessing dark thoughts to a close friend. Critics compared her to Louis C.K. Then #MeToo happened. President Emmanuel Macron moved to strip Mr. Weinstein of his Legion of Honor. French lawmakers passed legislation banning street harassment. A French journalist urged people to tweet the names of those who\u2019d sexually harassed them at work under the hashtag #BalanceTonPorc \u2014 expose your pig. But the movement never reached the fever pitch that it did in the United States. Some Frenchmen lost their jobs, but there was nothing like America\u2019s mass takedown of prominent men \u2014 often without any due process. In a much-criticized open letter in Le Monde, a group of high-profile Frenchwomen wrote that rape is a crime, but gallantry and even awkwardly hitting on a woman ought to be O.K. Ms. Gardin defended Louis C.K. after his fall from grace. \u201cObviously, people need to speak up. Women should feel free to make denunciations,\u201d she told the magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9rama. \u201cBut the fact that we put a producer who rapes actresses in the same bag as a guy whose fetish is to masturbate in front of women, after asking if he can do it, means our modern society has a big problem with nuance.\u201d She argued that it\u2019s hypocritical to shun Louis C.K. His humor, she noted, \u201cexplored his dark side, his perversions, and deciphered the darkness of the human soul.\u201d  \u201cPeople loved him for that,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it made them feel better about their own dark sides.\u201d In Ms. Gardin\u2019s newest show, which I saw recently here, gender relations are a major theme. Her message: They\u2019re complicated. You can pass a law against street harassment, but when a woman decorates herself like a Christmas tree, \u201cyou have to risk that someone says you\u2019re well-decorated,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the game.\u201d  Sexual violence is unacceptable, but she had to stop reading the #MeToo articles \u2014 often sultry tales of gorgeous actresses being ravished \u2014 because \u201cthey got me too excited.\u201d Ms. Gardin also has words for actresses who lament the dearth of leading roles for women over 40. \u201cI know that at 41, I\u2019m not as attractive as I was at 20,\u201d she tells the crowd. \u201cPeople tell me, \u2018You say that because you\u2019ve integrated a masculine vision of desire.\u2019 No, not at all.\u201d It\u2019s because, she says, \u201cWe\u2019re born, we grow up, we get stronger, we have a peak of physical and sensual power. And then we get older, and become weaker, and uglier, and we die. We need to digest that.\u201d Whereas the American version of #MeToo often seems like a battle of the sexes or a story of male domination, Ms. Gardin expresses sympathy for men. She describes how their desires can make them vulnerable, and how this can give women power. Men are driven to have sex, she says, while \u201cwe just need to get to the point where we can sense, in the man\u2019s eyes, that we can ruin his life.\u201d Lines like these infuriate some French feminists, who understandably feel that their complaints about sexual violence have been sidelined by a defense of gallantry and flirtation. One of them is Sandra Muller, the journalist who created #BalanceTonPorc and just published a book defending it. The hashtag movement is about the abuse of power: \u201cIt has never been against flirting, seduction or sex,\u201d she told L\u2019Obs magazine. \u201cFrance has mixed everything up and embarrassed itself in front of the world. It\u2019s a bit heartbreaking in the country of Simone de Beauvoir.\u201d A survey published last Monday found that 86 percent of Frenchwomen have been harassed on the street. Feminist groups have organized a march against sexism and sexual violence for this weekend. But Ms. Gardin is more popular than ever. This year she became the first woman to win the Moli\u00e8re for humor. In March, her new show will be broadcast live to more than 150 movie theaters in three countries. One Parisienne told me she started a WhatsApp group to discuss the comedian with friends, because she \u201cmanages to convey that things are more complex than what activists want us to believe.\u201d  In an era of so much exhausting groupthink, Ms. Gardin is refreshing because she doesn\u2019t seem to belong to any camp. She\u2019s what the French admiringly call a femme libre \u2014 a free woman. When she and Louis C.K. were photographed holding hands in New York in October, some on Twitter accused her of betraying #MeToo. But there\u2019s also a belief in France that everyone, even sinners, is entitled to love, and the French press has mostly been neutral or defended her. A writer in Marianne magazine quoted Victor Hugo: \u201cThe freedom to love is no less sacred than the freedom of thought.\u201d", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/louis-ck-blanche-gardin-metoo.html"},

{"title": "Can a Co-op Board Member Mine My Personal Information?", "description": "A co-op board application package contains sensitive information. What happens when a board member misuses it?", "author": "By Ronda Kaysen", "content": "Q: A week after I interviewed with a co-op board to buy an apartment, a salesman contacted my attorney and my financial planner, identifying himself as my personal friend, to solicit them to invest in a real estate deal. It turns out the salesman was one of the board members, and certainly not a friend. Can a board member \u2014 who has extensive access to personal and financial history \u2014 use a prospective owner\u2019s information for personal gain? It seems unethical, but is it also illegal? What can be done? A: The board member\u2019s behavior was certainly unethical, but probably not illegal, according to Adam Leitman Bailey, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. Since you did not suffer any financial loss because of his irresponsible behavior, you would not have grounds to sue him. However, the board member has a responsibility to act in the best interests of the board, the building and the residents who live in it. Instead, he acted in his own interests, violating your trust, misusing his power and dishonoring the co-op. People applying to live in a co-op are obligated to share the most intimate details of their financial lives with the board. In exchange, they expect discretion and professionalism. Candidates sometimes worry that a board may not properly dispose of an application after the review is complete, or misplace the materials. But you should be able to trust that the board won\u2019t turn around and try to make a business deal on the side based on your contacts. \u201cThis conduct is absolutely unethical,\u201d Mr. Bailey said. To protect its integrity, the board must investigate, either by forming a subcommittee to interview the parties involved, or by hiring outside counsel to do so. Once it has a full picture of what transpired (and it\u2019s possible this isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened), the board should ban such conduct and then take steps to enforce that ban.

{"title": "Opinion | Packing Tips for an Evacuation", "description": "Benefit from my hard-earned experience.", "author": "By Merrill Markoe", "content": "Three weeks ago, everyone in my house crammed our worldly belongings into a Prius and fled from the billowing black clouds that were racing toward us over the hills and down the canyons from the fast moving Woolsey Fire. Unlike the previous fires I\u2019d lived through, this one gave us no real warning. We woke to a mandatory evacuation notice from the city of Malibu, leaving us no choice but to wedge our car into a line of traffic creeping down the Pacific Coast Highway, the only artery out of the area. On the bright side, I got to see for the first time that when driving 1 mile per hour, the engine of my hybrid car really did rely on its electric part and consumed no gas during the six hours it took us to go less than 25 miles. On Tuesday, I was temporarily allowed back into the neighborhood for the first time in 12 days. It\u2019s hard to describe the gratitude and relief I felt at seeing my house still standing there, relatively unharmed. Even my uncleaned messes were as I remembered them. In fact, everything seemed relatively O.K. until I walked around the block and saw firsthand the once-lovely homes of friends that were now completely destroyed. And even the worst of what happened in my area doesn\u2019t compare with the stories that were coming out of Paradise, Calif., at the same time \u2014 a situation so terrifying it\u2019s beyond imagining. I don\u2019t know if the desire to try to take grim data and make it into something useful is built into human DNA or if it\u2019s simply a product of my having consumed too much self-help literature in the 1980s. But as I sit here camped out at a friend\u2019s house, waiting for the all-clear to return home, I find myself overcome with the desire to turn the experience into something useful.  I can\u2019t rebuild everyone\u2019s house by myself or do much to help those mourning loved ones lost in the Camp Fire. But I believe I can help you plan for when it\u2019s your turn to flee from the flood, fire, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, wildfire or nonspecific global warming related catastrophe that may be headed your way. In my experience, whatever your disaster, at some point a uniformed public servant will begin screaming at you through a bullhorn that you must leave now. But packing in preparation for fleeing involves making split second decisions without a clear head. This time as I packed, a voice in my head said, \u201cQuickly, just grab the clothes you like best.\u201d That seemingly sensible idea became the reason that I now wake up every morning to two pairs of pants that do not fit, five shirts that I cannot wear because they require dry cleaning and no shoes. Of course, I did better this time than I did with the last fire, when I wound up sleeping on a friend\u2019s couch for five days wrapped in the leashes of four large dogs. There, I made the unhappy discovery that I\u2019d packed no bras or underwear, yet had somehow brought along the program from my sixth grade dance recital. That is why I recommend that you maintain, year round, a carefully packed box containing important papers, such as your birth certificate, passport, insurance policies, selected sentimental photos that are too glued into bulky photo albums to be digitized. And by the way, why did you glue them down like that? What is wrong with you? But now is not the time for recriminations.  While you\u2019re in preparation mode, don\u2019t forget to include a list of all your internet passwords, even though it will turn out to be a futile gesture because every single site you sign onto during your emergency will tell you that your username or password is incorrect. So forget I even mentioned that one. Having accomplished that, breathe a sigh of relief, despite the fact that when you get to your place of safety, you will discover that repeated emergency raids to this prepacked box of important papers over the years have removed all things of importance and left in their place some old mail and a note full of incomprehensible jokes someone passed to you during a history test in the eighth grade. Why you took these things on an emergency evacuation will remain a mystery that will puzzle the ages. Some frequently asked questions about packing for an evacuation: Realize that all the items of clothing you pack will quickly blend together into one big mix-and-match outfit. You\u2019ll discover that the only T-shirt you packed says \u201cI\u2019m FUN!\u201d in 8-inch letters. (It was turned inside out in the drawer when you grabbed what you thought was a plain white shirt.) Just accept the fact that you\u2019ll be seen in public wearing it with a pair of plaid pajama bottoms, a straw hat and a shawl made out of a duvet cover. No. When I packed a lot of makeup this time, I forgot that an older woman dressed in a T-shirt that screams \u201cI\u2019m fun,\u201d only looks weirder if she also has a face full of makeup. You will have two choices: 1) Dorothea Lange\u2019s Dust Bowl studies 2) The entire canon of Diane Arbus. The best you can hope for, if all goes well, is a look that says: \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of doing my laundry. Oh, and by the way, in case you were wondering, I\u2019m fun.\u201d Your clothing choices are now a superpower. Understand that a disaster is sent from a universe that finds amusement in backing you into a corner to see what you will do. Would you like to see more rain? Pack only thin cotton shirts and flip-flops. Would you like the weather to warm up a little? Pack only clothes made of wool. Whatever climate you prepare for, the opposite will materialize \u2014 an unexpected consequence of imagining you can properly prepare for anything. Pack only the clothes that are comfortable and utilitarian enough to accommodate spending the night on the floor of a middle school cafeteria, yet are also perfect for cleaning out a refrigerator full of rotting food that has learned to masquerade as an aerial photo of Neptune as it patiently awaits your return. There is something else I\u2019ve learned in my multiple evacuations. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have made it somewhere safely, with Spotify intact, you discover that there\u2019s a Tom Petty song for every moment. Petty is the poet laureate of evacuation. Right now, I\u2019m humming \u201cFree Falling.\u201d Yesterday, I was singing \u201cDon\u2019t have to live like a refugee.\u201d It\u2019s probably not a coincidence that Tom Petty was a resident of Malibu.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/packing-tips-for-an-evacuation.html"},
{"title": "Opinion | Marrying Him Was Political. Sponsoring His Visa Is for Love.", "description": "Our romantic, pragmatic green-card wedding day.", "author": "By Jessa Crispin", "content": "We were sitting in a dive bar in Kansas City, Mo., with two whiskey sodas, and the man I had met only 10 days before said he had an important question to ask me. The last \u201cimportant question\u201d was, \u201cWhat is your relationship to potato chips?\u201d which he\u2019d asked while gesturing to the many bags of various flavors piled in my pantry (the answer, of course, being, \u201cPotato chips are my soul mate\u201d), so it wasn\u2019t as if I was expecting anything electric to come out of his mouth. I looked at him, and he said with a steady gaze, \u201cWould you marry me?\u201d I felt the strangest thing. Not joy, not shock, not fear. I felt calm. Calm, as everyone who knows me is aware, is a rare feeling for me. But first I had to make sure he wasn\u2019t making fun of me. \u201cIs that a hypothetical or a practical question?\u201d \u201cBoth,\u201d he said. \u201cThen yes.\u201d We ordered another round, set a date for a courthouse wedding four days later and immediately begin to text our friends. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d was a typical response. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d I ignored them. Drunk on whiskey and other stuff, we stumbled out of the bar. As I stood on the curb to hail a cab, he ran to the drugstore next door. \u201cJust need to get something.\u201d He came back out, his arms full of potato chips, bags of every flavor they had on the shelves. But marriage is not about love. It is about politics. All of my adult life I have argued for the abolition of marriage, because marriage is a series of rights unfairly distributed to men and women who have found love or who have deluded themselves into thinking they have found love. If romantic love is its own reward, as every Hollywood film and novel in the \u201cwomen\u2019s fiction\u201d section at the bookstore would have us believe, then why pile on tax breaks, hospital visitation, health insurance, immigration assistance and all of the rest of it? Having a successful love life should not have a determination on whether you live or die.  One American friend of mine is chronically ill but had the very good fortune to fall in love with a German man, gaining access to a nationalized health service and an expedited immigration process. Being away from the broken American health care system and the even more broken Medicaid insurance system for the poor and disadvantaged, my friend has renewed health, more energy, a higher income that comes with a larger capacity for work, and optimism for the first time in years. An Indian friend of ours had the very good fortune to fall in love with an American woman, giving him access to an expedited immigration process and a more easily attainable work visa, allowing him to keep his job at an institution that despite pulling in millions of dollars a year in grants and donations decided that sponsoring its immigrant workers\u2019 visas wasn\u2019t worth the investment of time and money. And then the wife of my husband\u2019s friend \u2014 she had the misfortune of falling deeply in love with a Colombian man, with his own already shaky migration status, and the United States government announced it would not be approving her application for an extension of her residency visa and gave her 30 days to pack up the four years of life she had built in New York City. She had no guarantee that she would be able to return or that the two of them could find a place where both of them would have the ability to work and live. What does that do to love, when one realizes how politically convenient or inconvenient this partnership will be for you? Holding my partner\u2019s hand at the immigration lawyer\u2019s office, I wanted so much to give this to him: a stabilized future, the ability to live and work where he wanted, a larger canvas for his ambitions. And yet something in me started to draw back at that moment. A whirlwind adventure of love and romance started to look like a strategic seduction. \u201cHe might fear that I might be mercenary.\u201d I keep thinking of that line, spoken by Morris Townsend in the movie \u201cThe Heiress,\u201d based on Henry James\u2019s \u201cWashington Square.\u201d In the story, Catherine Sloper is a woman with no charm, no grace. Her manner of dress runs toward the tacky and the shiny, and she has that haunted look of a person who has been told love will find her, and when it doesn\u2019t, rather than sitting and calmly waiting for that day, she frantically runs from place to place, asking every man she comes across, \u201cAre you the one who has come to save me?\u201d What she does have is $30,000 a year, a sizable inheritance. Morris Townsend has no career, nor any real inclination to work, but he does have a taste for the finer things in life, and in the film, Montgomery Clift\u2019s face. He knows it looks bad, the penniless suitor chasing after an heiress. He doesn\u2019t help his case by anticipating the father\u2019s suspicions, and vocalizing them: \u201cHe might fear that I might be mercenary.\u201d Well, how could people not, with the gangly girl whom he professes to ardently adore standing before them. But she has no hesitation, not even a moment of doubt. This is the love she was promised, and she will cling to it like the life raft that it so clearly is, no matter what her father tries to do to break them apart. James does two things. The first is that he allows Morris\u2019s intentions to be ambiguous. He is neither rogue nor saint. Catherine, despite all of her failings, has a sharp wit and a kind heart. It is not her fault that women are not generally pursued for their sharp wit and kind hearts, but he allows the reader to love her and hope that Morris has an unconventional taste in women. But the other thing James does is suggest that maybe it doesn\u2019t matter whether Morris loves her or not, as long as he takes care of her. Is it a tragedy to make love a transaction? To say I will stand by your side as long as I get tailored suits from Paris and sherry imported from Spain and cigars from Cuba? Or health insurance for my chronic illness? Or a residency visa? I, too, have around $30,000 a year, although a hundred years after James wrote his book, that is not the prize it once was. And also like Catherine, I have all the grace of an elephant in high heels, my knees decorated with an ever shifting display of bruises from my stumbling into things, and my manner of dress also runs toward the tacky and the shiny. I have my assets, an intelligence and an accomplished body of work, but women in our culture are not pursued for intelligence and accomplished bodies of work, certainly not by considerably younger men. As such, my lover resembles Morris, in his effortless charm, his handsome face and his desire for something I could easily provide. Unlike Catherine, I am aware of my failings and how on paper this match seems so unlikely. I am also attuned to the doubt that runs through our social circle, with my friends making cracks about our green-card marriage, and the confusion that comes into his friends\u2019 faces when they are introduced to me. If this were solely practical, a bloodless transaction for a much-needed visa, or if it were solely romantic, just two people so taken with each other the concerns of the world mattered not to us, this marriage would make more sense to me. It is the mix that knots my stomach at times and turns me cold. Marrying him was a political act, and sponsoring him for a visa is a devotional act. We are amassing a file to prove that this relationship is real and not a transaction. The American government gives you a list of things it will be looking for to prove the legitimacy of your love. Under the heading \u201cshared property,\u201d you can have a lease with both of your names on it, a joint bank account, jointly filed taxes. Under the heading of social presence, it wants to see pictures of you on vacation together, party invitations addressed to both of you, social media posts featuring you as a couple. Our lawyer gave us a list of sample questions to prepare for the inevitable interview with a bureaucrat who will officially declare whether or not our love is real: \u201cWhat color is your partner\u2019s toothbrush?\u201d \u201cWhat is your partner\u2019s favorite food?\u201d \u201cWhat are the names of your partner\u2019s extended family members?\u201d The file wears on both of us. Pictures we take of each other are both for us and for the government. When I say, \u201cWhat\u2019s your niece\u2019s name again?\u201d I\u2019m asking it to set it in my brain for the eventual quiz, not out of curiosity.  But the government\u2019s file is different from the one in my head. It\u2019s not going to sway any official to learn how I felt when I discovered that for weeks my lover had been, without telling me, going on Twitter, searching for my name and liking every nice thing said about my writing there. Or how frequently he grabs for my hand when we are walking down the street. Or his urgent kiss when the judge declared us wed. Once, as we sat going through the endless pile of paperwork, he asked me, \u201cDid you ever think this marriage was a scam?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I said, although the look on his face made me wish I had lied.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/marriage-love-immigration-green-card.html"},
{"title": "Costly Raising of Argentine Submarine May Not Yield Answers or Bodies, Experts Say", "description": "Families of some of the 44 crew members who sank with the San Juan want it salvaged, but experts question the operation.", "author": "By Daniel Politi", "content": "MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina \u2014 An Argentine submarine found deep on the ocean floor a year after it vanished with 44 people on board may rest there despite pleas from family members of the crew, who hope for a salvage operation that experts say would be costly and unlikely to yield new information. Experts say the salvage operation appears to be feasible. But the financially struggling administration of President Mauricio Macri is not eager to pay for it despite pressure from families who want to recover the bodies of their loved ones. For now, the only official in a position to order the vessel to be lifted quickly does not seem in a hurry to do so. Marta Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, the federal judge who is in charge of the investigation into the sinking of the submarine, the San Juan, is working with experts to review 67,000 photographs and videos of the submarine and its surroundings to determine what exactly happened to the vessel. But it is unclear how long the review could take, she said. Those images are to be provided by the end of the month by Ocean Infinity, the Houston-based company that found the San Juan a week ago. If they don\u2019t provide a clear explanation and if it appears her investigation would be helped by studying the sub itself, Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez could order a feasibility study to find if the San Juan could be lifted from the seabed. The judge has made clear she would order it pulled up only if it helped the investigation, not for any other reason. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to have to be patient,\u201d said Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez in a phone interview from her courthouse in Caleta Olivia in the southern province of Santa Cruz. Among the relatives of the submarine\u2019s crew members, who have been waiting more than a year for news of their loved ones, patience is in short supply. \u201cThe judge is very slow,\u201d complained Natalia Tocon\u00e1s, 33, whose brother, Mario Armando Tocon\u00e1s, was aboard the San Juan. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to us to pressure her to act.\u201d The demand for the vessel\u2019s salvage is a new chapter in the families\u2019 long battle with officials for answers. Many family members believe the Argentine government would have never hired Ocean Infinity, promising a $7.5 million payout if the submarine was found, if it had not been for the pressure they exerted, including camping outside the presidential palace in Buenos Aires for almost two months. \u201cIf you don\u2019t fight, no one does anything for you,\u201d explained Alejandra Aguilera, 43, who is also a sister of Mr. Tocon\u00e1s. \u201cNow we are going after the judge.\u201d Some family members have filmed a video calling on Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez to order the lifting of the San Juan, which they plan to release once she receives the images from Ocean Infinity. Mirta Laz, 70, the mother of another crew member, Alberto S\u00e1nchez, was one of approximately two dozen family members who gathered this past week outside the naval base in Mar del Plata, a coastal city that was the base of the San Juan, to demand that the submarine be lifted. \u201cThis is just getting started,\u201d she said. \u201cWe finally know where it is. We need to go get it.\u201d Not all family members agree. Luis Tagliapietra, who is the father of Alejandro Tagliapietra, was aboard the Ocean Infinity-operated search vessel as one of four auditors representing family members when the San Juan was found. Running such a huge operation to pull up the submarine made no sense to him, he said. \u201cHe was a sailor, he loved the sea,\u201d Mr. Tagliapietra said of his son. Defense Minister Oscar Aguad is also moving to tamp down expectations of a salvage operation, telling the Clar\u00edn newspaper that because of the depth of almost 3,000 feet and \u201cwhere it is located, it is a technologically impossible mission.\u201d Experts, however, disagree. A salvage operation would not be simple or cheap, but there\u2019s no reason to believe it couldn\u2019t be done. Whether it is worthwhile though is another matter, they said. \u201cThere are many operations that were perceived to be close to impossible\u201d before they were carried out successfully, said Richard Janssen, managing director of SMIT Salvage, a subsidiary of the Dutch company Boskalis. SMIT was one of the two companies responsible for raising the Kursk, a Russian nuclear-powered submarine that sank in the Barents Sea in August 2000 with 118 crew members aboard. That submarine was 380 feet below the surface of the water, compared with almost 3,000 feet for the San Juan, but it was also eight times larger. While the Kursk\u2019s raising is often mentioned as an example of what a San Juan salvage operation might resemble, efforts to salvage wrecks from deeper depths give a better sense of the chances of the Argentine submarine\u2019s recovery. SMIT, for example, recovered the Japanese vessel Ehime Maru in one piece from a depth of around 2,000 feet off the Hawaiian coast in 2001. Considering how much technology has improved since then, going an additional 1,000 feet down to reach the San Juan should not be seen as prohibitive, as that depth is nothing out of the ordinary in oil and gas exploration, Mr. Janssen said. Also, the San Juan would hardly be the deepest salvage ever undertaken. The C.I.A. \u2014 with the help of the billionaire Howard Hughes \u2014 carried out a Cold War-era operation to recover parts from a Soviet submarine that in 1968 sunk three miles deep in the Pacific. Stewart Little, who runs the Submarine Rescue Consultancy and worked with submarines for more than 30 years in the British Royal Navy, said technical issues were not the problem. \u201cIs it feasible?\u201d Mr. Little said. \u201cYes. Is it too deep? No. It\u2019s just the financing that would be an issue.\u201d Although the operation\u2019s potential cost is difficult to assess without detailed information about the seabed and the state of the submarine, Mr. Little estimated that any salvage effort would have to start with a budget of about $100 million. The real question that must be answered before an operation is begun, experts said, is why. \u201cConsidering the San Juan imploded, there may not be much in the way of remains inside and even if there are, it likely won\u2019t be all of them,\u201d said Neil Hopkins, who worked at the British Defense Ministry for 30 years as a civil engineer specializing in submarine design and construction. He now runs Sonistics, a company that specializes in submarine rescues. If the submarine is raised, he said, \u201cDo you say to 44 families, we can identify 14 of them but not the other 30?\u201d One reason to spend money salvaging the vessel would be to get information to prevent future accidents, but considering the age of the San Juan, within five years that information would not be relevant to any other submarine in operation, and the whole effort would be \u201can academic exercise with no practical value,\u201d Mr. Little said. As an alternative to salvaging, the Argentine Navy could designate the submarine a grave and come up with a plan to take the families to the site once a year so they could pay their respects, Mr. Hopkins suggested.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/americas/argentina-submarine-san-juan.html"},
{"title": "A Case of \u2018Catfishing,\u2019 Blackmail and Sexual Abuse Rattles Norway ", "description": "A 26-year-old man has been accused of impersonating a teenage girl online to lure hundreds of boys into sending him explicit images and of abusing some of them offline.", "author": "By Iliana Magra", "content": "LONDON \u2014 The 26-year-old man pretended to be a teenage girl to meet boys and young men on online chat forums. He called himself \u201cSandra\u201d or \u201cHenriette,\u201d met boys from Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and asked them to send explicit images and videos, prosecutors say.  When they complied, he threatened to publish the footage on YouTube if they did not keep the images coming. He talked a few into meeting in person. Then, officials said, he raped some of them. The Norwegian man \u2014 identified only as Henrik, a soccer referee \u2014 was charged last Friday with sexually abusing more than 300 boys in three countries beginning in 2011. The authorities found more than 16,000 explicit films of victims on the suspect\u2019s computer.  Two years after another major sexual assault case in the small Norwegian community of Tysfjord in Lapland sent shock waves through the country, the scale of the abuse in this \u201ccatfishing\u201d case prompted a lawyer for the victims to describe it as \u201cincomparable in Norwegian legal history.\u201d \u201cThis is the largest case of abuses that has ever been uncovered, with an enormous scope, and harsh acts,\u201d Christian Lundin, the main lawyer representing victims in the case, said in an email. The case is set to go to trial on Jan. 22, with 11 lawyers representing the victims, who have not been named. \u201cThe indictment is 81 pages long, and it covers a range of different sexual offenses, including rape,\u201d Guro Hansson Bull, one of the three prosecutors handling the case, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. The large number of victims was possible because of only one thing, Ms. Hansson Bull said: the perpetrator having access to children online. \u201cThe problem is the internet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to reach so many victims through the internet.\u201d While the issue is not unique to Norway, the country has grappled with high-profile cases of sexual abuse, like the one in Tysfjord, where officials identified more than 150 victims. In another so-called catfishing case in 2017, a 27-year- old man was convicted of online abuse in a case involving 53 girls, ages 12 to 17, whom he met via chat apps. He was sentenced to 17 years in prison. According to the Norwegian Center for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, 21 percent of Norwegian women and 8 percent of Norwegian men say they were sexually abused before the age of 18.  Thor Steinhovden, an adviser at the Norwegian think tank Agenda, says the catfishing case may be the largest incidence of online sexual abuse in Norwegian history. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had similar, online-related molestation cases,\u201d Mr. Steinhovden said in a phone interview on Friday. \u201cThese cases have increased quite a bit in the last five to six years,\u201d he added.  Under Norwegian criminal law, sexual abuse over the internet is legally the same as physical sexual abuse, and the number of online sexual offenses is increasing as more young people get access to smartphones and the web, according to the authorities. Reports to the police of criminal sexual acts against children under 16 rose to 833 from 227 between 2004 and 2017, according to the Norwegian Statistical Bureau. Like the prosecutor, Mr. Steinhovden suggested that Norway\u2019s increasing cybersophistication had opened a gateway to more such cases. \u201cNorway has one of the highest digital competencies in the world \u2014 87 percent of children aged 9 to 11 have access to smartphones, and it makes them more vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Steinhovden said. The rate increases to 97 percent for children 12 to 14 years old, according to a report by the Norwegian Media Authority. \u201cWe\u2019re just catching up with the side effects,\u201d he said, \u201cand the debate about whether we should regulate our use, and how we should do it, is just getting started.\u201d In the latest case of catfishing \u2014 in which someone adopts a phony online personality to lure others \u2014 only two victims initially came forward, despite hundreds of them being identified in videos and via chat logs. One boy spoke to his parents about it, the authorities said, and the mother of another boy figured it out and alerted officials. Those two complaints spurred an investigation in 2016, which concluded in June. Indictments were handed up this month.  The reluctance of victims to step forward further complicated the case; some have declined to talk to investigators even after police identified hundreds of victims, Ms. Hansson Bull said. \u201cI think maybe it\u2019s the shame; they\u2019re trying to minimize the case, trying not to tell,\u201d she noted.  Until the police approached them, some victims had not realized they were part of a scam.  \u201cSome victims didn\u2019t even know they were abused, even when they were threatened,\u201d Ms. Hansson Bull said, as the suspect was still pretending to be a girl. The online abuse started in 2011, but most of the offenses in the indictment were committed from 2014 to 2016, according to Ms. Hansson Bull. During that period, 460 boys and young men, ages 9 to 18, were abused, she said, but only 300 \u2014 \u201cthe most severe cases\u201d \u2014 were included in the indictment. The offender used messaging applications like Kik and LINE to contact victims. He persuaded the boys to send him sexually explicit images and videos. In some cases, boys were promised corresponding images from Sandra or Henriette. In others, they were threatened with public humiliation and release of the sensitive material online to get them to send him more. One boy sent Henrik 91 explicit videos, according to the indictment.  He also met about 20 boys in person, pretending to be a friend of his female alias, Ms. Hansson Bull said.  Besides sexual assault, the defendant is accused of paying some of the boys for sexual acts, which took place in his home in Fetsund, a riverside town less than 18 miles east of Oslo, Norway\u2019s capital, and in other places nearby. Some victims have asked for compensation for the abuse and the deception from the courts; the exact amount will depend on the claims victims put forward, according Ms. Hansson Bull.

{"title": "Opinion | The Two-Emperor Problem", "description": "What Trump v. John Roberts reveals about the Republic.", "author": "By Ross Douthat", "content": "Generally, Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter beefs are an expense of spirit and a waste of breath. But a minority of them are genuinely edifying, and illustrations of his likely world-historical role \u2014 which is not to personally bring down our constitutional republic, but to reveal truths about our political situation, through his crudeness and goading of others, that might be harbingers of the Republic\u2019s eventual end. Last week\u2019s beef with Chief Justice John Roberts was such a case. After the president complained that an \u201cObama judge\u201d from the Ninth Circuit had ruled against his administration\u2019s asylum policy, the chief justice issued a highly unusual rebuke, declaring that \u201cwe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d and an \u201cindependent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\u201d This predictably inspired a tweeted rejoinder from the president: \u201cSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u2018Obama judges,\u2019 \u201d Trump began, before dilating on his grievances against the Ninth Circuit\u2019s alleged overreach. [Listen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] The Official Washington response to this beef was to accuse Trump of once again degrading important constitutional norms \u2014 which in a sense his attack on the idea that judges\u2019 legitimacy transcends the partisan origins of their appointments obviously did. But to anyone who lived through the Merrick Garland and Brett Kavanaugh nominations, the idea that this norm would be resilient absent Trump\u2019s Twitter provocations seems laughable. What was once a conservative assumption dismissed as extremism by the bien-pensants \u2014 that the Supreme Court is a highly ideological institution defined by partisan bias and anti-democratic overreach \u2014 is now a commonplace liberal belief as well. And when non-Trump politicians hail about the court\u2019s independence, it\u2019s usually just an exercise in tribalism with no consistency behind it. In this sense the really telling tweet last week came from Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, who weighed in with the following praise \u2014 or \u201cpraise,\u201d perhaps \u2014 for the chief justice: \u201cI don\u2019t agree very often with Chief Justice Roberts, especially his partisan decisions which seem highly political on Citizens United, Janus, and Shelby. But I am thankful today that he \u2014 almost alone among Republicans \u2014 stood up to President Trump and for an independent judiciary.\u201d Read these sentences over a few times, and relish their internal contradictions. John Roberts is to be commended for standing up for an \u201cindependent judiciary,\u201d Schumer suggests, so long as he is attacking President Trump. But when he is issuing rulings with which Schumer disagrees, he is a \u201cpartisan\u201d and \u201chighly political\u201d and a \u201cRepublican.\u201d Save for the pious tone there is little practical difference between this intervention and Trump\u2019s rants about \u201cObama judges.\u201d Which in turn suggests that in the case of Trump v. Roberts, our president is mostly just exposing a degradation that already exists, acknowledging a truth of our constitutional order that\u2019s badly disguised by official-D.C. politesse. That truth reflects an old problem joined to several new ones. The old problem is that the Supreme Court\u2019s legal supremacy over the White House depends upon the presidency\u2019s willingness to accept the court\u2019s rulings. From Andrew Jackson\u2019s conflict with John Marshall over Cherokee removal to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s suspension of habeas corpus to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s attempts to force the court to accept the New Deal, there have always been tensions in the American republic between judicial authority and presidential power. To that centuries-old tension the last few decades have added several more. The growth of partisan polarization has increased the potential ideological hostility between the branches, and raised the perceived stakes of presidential elections and high court appointments both. Meanwhile, the liberal ambitions of the Warren Court and the expanded powers of the Cold War presidency made both branches considerably more imperial relative to both Congress and the states, and neither trend has been substantially reversed. Instead the political abdication of the Congress, the steady atrophy of legislative power and flight from legislative responsibility, means that America is increasingly governed by negotiations between the imperial presidency and whichever philosopher-king has the swing vote on the court. A dual imperialism is still a separation of power, and a decaying republic with two emperors by definition does not have its Caesar or Augustus yet. Nor are we about to get one: Because Trump is too politically weak to win a stark confrontation with the Supreme Court, and Roberts is temperamentally modest and consensus-oriented, their Twitter beef is an illumination of reality, rather than a step into crisis. So there is time for an anti-imperial rebalancing, in which a more assertive Congress somehow brings us back into constitutional equilibrium. But if Congress prefers abdication, a two-emperor system isn\u2019t built to last. Come a crisis, one (probably the one that commands the military and law enforcement) must be master, the other must submit. That\u2019s the important message of Trump v. Roberts. Let those with ears, hear.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/john-roberts-donald-trump.html"},
{"title": "Taiwan\u2019s President Quits as Party Chief After Stinging Losses in Local Races", "description": "With a presidential election only 14 months away, the results gave a big lift to the opposition Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China.", "author": "By Chris Horton", "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 The president of Taiwan resigned as leader of her party Saturday night after it suffered stunning local election defeats to the opposition Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China. The self-ruled island\u2019s political landscape was shaken up by voters who delivered a sharp rebuke to President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s governing Democratic Progressive Party, or D.P.P., in elections contesting more than 11,000 seats from city mayors to neighborhood wardens. The results of the election, which was seen as a referendum on Ms. Tsai\u2019s first two years in office, have given the Kuomintang a new lease on life and complicated Ms. Tsai\u2019s bid for re-election 14 months from now. Shortly after it became apparent that the D.P.P. would lose crucial mayoral races, Ms. Tsai resigned her position as party leader, raising the possibility that she would be challenged for her party\u2019s nomination for the presidential election in January 2020. \u201cAs this party\u2019s chair, I take full responsibility for the outcome of today\u2019s local elections,\u201d she said at a hastily assembled news conference at D.P.P. headquarters in Taipei. \u201cPeople believe in democratic values \u2014 today democracy taught us a lesson.\u201d Opposition Kuomintang mayoral candidates won in Taiwan\u2019s three largest cities \u2014 New Taipei City, Taichung and Kaohsiung. The Kaohsiung contest was especially stinging for the D.P.P., which has held the mayor\u2019s office for 20 years and considered the southern city a political stronghold. Han Kuo-yu, the Kuomintang\u2019s candidate for mayor in Kaohsiung, emerged as the story of the election, defeating his D.P.P. opponent, Chen Chi-mai, who at the outset of the election campaign had been expected to win easily. \u201cAll of Taiwan, all of the ethnic Chinese worldwide, can see the change in Kaohsiung,\u201d Mr. Han said in his victory speech at a large rally. Before the election, he attained celebrity status for his populist and occasionally politically incorrect style. In the final weeks of campaigning, he took that popularity on the road, stumping for Kuomintang candidates around Taiwan, which may have helped decide several close races. Ko Wen-je, the independent mayor of Taipei and one of the most popular politicians in Taiwan, appears to have barely defeated his Kuomintang opponent, Ting Shou-chung. The close outcome may make Mr. Ko less likely to throw his hat into the ring in the presidential campaign. Mr. Ting has contested the result. Mayors in Taiwan are similar in stature to governors in the United States, and the Kuomintang mayors offer potential new dialogue partners for Beijing, which refuses to engage with Ms. Tsai and could use them to further isolate her and increase China\u2019s involvement in Taiwan politics. The Communist Party of China seeks to annex Taiwan, which it has never ruled, and refuses to speak with Ms. Tsai unless she accepts the stance held by her Kuomintang predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, that Taiwan and China are both part of the same country, with potentially different interpretations of what that country is on either side of the Strait. China has done all it can to put pressure on Ms. Tsai since she took office in 2016. In the hope of seeing her become Taiwan\u2019s first one-term president, Beijing has poached Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic allies, increased military exercises near its borders and pressured companies to list the self-ruled democracy as a part of China on their websites. In recent weeks, Taiwanese officials, including Ms. Tsai herself, accused China of trying to influence Taiwan\u2019s election through online misinformation aimed at undermining confidence in the D.P.P. China has rejected the accusations. Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice is also investigating 33 cases of alleged illegal funding of candidates by China, but has not disclosed who is under investigation. Taiwan voters all file paper ballots, which are hand counted so they cannot be hacked. While China is always a factor, Taiwanese voters also had plenty of local concerns in this election, including stagnant wage growth and severe air pollution in the island\u2019s south. Several referendum questions concerned same-sex marriage, with voters expressing overwhelming opposition to it. They also supported the removal of gender equity content from school textbooks, which is seen as a major factor behind the strong support for gay rights among Taiwanese youth. A ruling last year by Taiwan\u2019s constitutional court gave the government until May 2019 to legalize same-sex marriage. The referendum results increased the likelihood that Taiwan will adopt separate civil union status for same-sex couples rather than offering them the same legal status as heterosexual married couples. A referendum question asking whether the island should be referred to as \u201cTaiwan\u201d rather than \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d at the Olympic Games and other international sporting events failed to pass after a last-minute push by opponents, including some Taiwanese athletes, who warned that the name change could lead to Taiwan being banned from the Olympics. Speaking at an election result viewing party in the Wenshan district of Taipei, a Kuomintang volunteer, Lin Mei-chuan, said she disapproved of the Tsai administration\u2019s handling of the economy as well as relations with China. \u201cPeople want a change,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for someone else to run things.\u201d", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/asia/taiwan-election-results.html"},
{"title": "A Big New Airport Shows China\u2019s Strengths (and Weaknesses)", "description": "Built in just five years, Beijing\u2019s new airport will be one of the world\u2019s largest. But it might not have been needed if the military hadn\u2019t claimed most of China\u2019s airspace.", "author": "By Ian Johnson", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 Rising out of the farmlands of southern Beijing in a web of concrete, rebar and glass, one of the world\u2019s largest airports is preparing to open after just five years of construction \u2014 a striking contrast to the infrastructure travails of far richer places. (See: New York City, subway; Britain, train service; Berlin, airport.) Just as impressive as its speed are the airport\u2019s broader goals. It is meant to shift the Chinese capital\u2019s center of gravity away from its high-tech university district in the north toward its poorer southern suburbs \u2014 part of an even more ambitious plan to remake Beijing and its hinterland into an 82,000-square-mile economic locomotive for northern China. And it will do so by relocating thousands of residents with few protests, at least so far. Yet the airport also reflects a less glamorous side of China\u2019s rapid change: a reliance on the heavy hand of big infrastructure as a salve for deeper problems in politics and economics. These intractable problems include an overbearing military, whose dominance of Chinese airspace hobbles existing airports, as well as a broad retreat from market-driven economic reforms, leading to a dependence on infrastructure investment to increase growth.  \u201cIn China everything is related to economic development,\u201d said Guo Yufeng, chief executive of Q&A Consulting, a China-based aviation advisory firm that has studied the new airport. \u201cThey needed something to drive growth.\u201d Cue the new airport. Scheduled to open next September, the Beijing Daxing International Airport will lift China\u2019s capital into the stratosphere of aviation superlatives. The golden, starfish-shaped terminal designed by the Iraqi-British star architect Zaha Hadid, who died in 2016, is billed as the world\u2019s largest at 7.5 million square feet (700,000 square meters) but promises short walking distances despite its size. By 2025, the airport will be able to serve 72 million passengers a year. That, along with the existing Beijing Capital International Airport\u2019s annual capacity of 96 million passengers, would make Beijing one of the world\u2019s busiest city airport systems, rivaling for top spot the 170 million carried by London\u2019s six airports, based on 2017 figures. Ultimately, Daxing is expected to handle 100 million passengers a year. One reason for the new airport is rapidly increasing passenger volumes, which rose in 2017 by nearly 13 percent nationwide. Aviation experts say, however, that at least some of this could be handled with existing infrastructure, were it not for the military\u2019s heavy hand. With roughly 70 percent of airspace controlled by the military (versus 20 percent in the United States), commercial aircraft flying in China are limited to narrow tunnels in the sky. This restricts options for departure and arrival routing, cutting the number of takeoffs and landings that airports can handle. Beijing Capital, for example, was the world\u2019s second-busiest airport based on passenger volume in 2017, but it ranked fifth based on takeoffs and landings, nearly a third fewer than the world leader, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The lack of airspace is also a key reason delays are so common in China. Last year, flight delays increased 50 percent, with only 71 percent of flights taking off on time, according to government statistics. That\u2019s helped push Chinese airlines to the bottom of punctuality rankings, with one study ranking three Chinese airlines as the worst among 20 large-scale carriers. Although aviation authorities blame the weather for half of the delays, Mr. Guo of Q&A Consulting said the underlying cause was the military-induced lack of airspace. When a corridor is blocked by a thunderstorm, for example, Chinese flight controllers often cannot reroute an airplane, because it would have to enter military airspace. That causes planes to sit on the ground or fly holding patterns when in other countries they could land or take off. \u201cThe congestion takes place in the sky because the military only allows for a certain number of tunnels,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t change, the ground infrastructure needs to be expanded.\u201d The new airport will help by initially opening four, then up to eight, new runways in the suburb of Daxing, 41 miles southwest of Beijing Capital. The number of air corridors available for civilian use stays the same, but the new runways will provide airlines with more ways to gain access to this limited airspace, allowing the Beijing area to facilitate more flights. The biggest challenge in building new airports is usually land, said Jean-Paul Rodrigue, who studies global infrastructure at Hofstra University. \u201cSize is just a matter of scaling up \u2014 you hire a good architect and a few consulting firms and they\u2019ll give you a nice design,\u201d Professor Rodrigue said. \u201cBut the major challenge is to find the piece of real estate in order to do that. It\u2019s mind-boggling how much this takes.\u201d Beijing Daxing occupies 18 square miles of land, more than two-thirds the size of Manhattan, in southern Beijing and the adjacent province of Hebei. It\u2019s trumpeted as a key part of the \u201cJing-Jin-Ji\u201d economic development plan, which will unite Beijing, Hebei, and the port city of Tianjin into an economic region to rival the country\u2019s more prosperous economic hubs, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Obtaining this land wasn\u2019t a problem, because in China all land is owned by the state. Protests do occur in China when communities are razed to make way for megaprojects \u2014 especially in years past, when some people killed themselves rather than lose their homes. But decades of forced evictions seem to have taught both sides some lessons. For residents, it\u2019s the futility of opposition. \u201cWho wants to leave?\u201d said Li Zhengu, a resident of Ligezhuang village, one of 11 that are being demolished, along with 24 others where people are being moved to avoid noise. \u201cBut there wasn\u2019t any discussion.\u201d Indeed, local media reported little about the relocation of more than 20,000 people, let alone broader questions about whether the increased traffic could be handled by Beijing Capital if the military loosened its grip on airspace. Instead, the new airport was portrayed as further proof of China\u2019s rise. Besides clamping down on public discussion, the government is offering what residents say are generous packages. Residents say that on average, they are getting 50 square meters per person in living space, $150,000 per family in one-time compensation and a monthly stipend of $300 to cover basic living costs. Mr. Li said the money was fair, but added: \u201cThen you don\u2019t have land to grow on. And you have to figure out a new life.\u201d As he spoke, a live broadcast echoed through the village: \u201cDon\u2019t complain,\u201d a male voice said through large loudspeakers. \u201cYou could influence the entire village\u2019s stability.\u201d Stability, though, can be defined in other ways. Chen Zhen, a 29-year-old data processor at a local bank, said the older generation in his family was stunned by the destruction of their family home. \u201cIn my family, I\u2019m fine, but my octogenarian grandma, she spent her whole life painstakingly building the courtyard home, one brick and one tile at a time,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cAfterward, we didn\u2019t dare go back to look.\u201d Five minutes down the road is the village of Qigezhuang, which would lie in such a noisy area that it would no longer be habitable. Its brick-and-tiled courtyard homes were flattened in August. A muddy teddy bear lay on the road, across from old millstones strewn across the rubble. Behind a corrugated fence, an elevated highway curled gracefully toward the orange terminal building in the distance. A late autumn wind crackled through the yellowing leaves, drowning out the enormous dump trucks and backhoes in the distance and making the scene seem unreal \u2014 that someone, somewhere, had decided that one way of life would end and another would begin.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/asia/china-beijing-daxing-airport.html"},
{"title": "Trump Administration Invites Health Care Industry to Help Rewrite Ban on Kickbacks", "description": "The goal is to open pathways for doctors and hospitals to work together to improve care and save money. The challenge will be to accomplish that without also increasing the risk of fraud.", "author": "By Robert Pear", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has labored zealously to cut federal regulations, but its latest move has still astonished some experts on health care: It has asked for recommendations to relax rules that prohibit kickbacks and other payments intended to influence care for people on Medicare or Medicaid. The goal is to open pathways for doctors and hospitals to work together to improve care and save money. The challenge will be to accomplish that without also increasing the risk of fraud. With its request for advice, the administration has touched off a lobbying frenzy. Health care providers of all types are urging officials to waive or roll back the requirements of federal fraud and abuse laws so they can join forces and coordinate care, sharing cost reductions and profits in ways that would not otherwise be allowed. From hundreds of letters sent to the government by health care executives and lobbyists in the last few weeks, some themes emerge: Federal laws prevent insurers from rewarding Medicare patients who lose weight or take medicines as prescribed. And they create legal risks for any arrangement in which a hospital pays a bonus to doctors for cutting costs or achieving clinical goals. The existing rules are aimed at preventing improper influence over choices of doctors, hospitals and prescription drugs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The two programs cover more than 100 million Americans and account for more than one-third of all health spending, so even small changes in law enforcement priorities can have big implications. Federal health officials are reviewing the proposals for what they call a \u201cregulatory sprint to coordinated care\u201d even as the Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies crack down on health care fraud, continually exposing schemes to bilk government health programs. \u201cThe administration is inviting companies in the health care industry to write a \u2018get out of jail free card\u2019 for themselves, which they can use if they are investigated or prosecuted,\u201d said James J. Pepper, a lawyer outside Philadelphia who has represented many whistle-blowers in the industry. Federal laws make it a crime to offer or pay any \u201cremuneration\u201d in return for the referral of Medicare or Medicaid patients, and they limit doctors\u2019 ability to refer patients to medical businesses in which the doctors have a financial interest, a practice known as self-referral. These laws \u201cimpose undue burdens on physicians and serve as obstacles to coordinated care,\u201d said Dr. James L. Madara, the chief executive of the American Medical Association. The laws, he said, were enacted decades ago \u201cin a fee-for-service world that paid for services on a piecemeal basis.\u201d Melinda R. Hatton, senior vice president and general counsel of the American Hospital Association, said the laws stifle \u201cmany innocuous or beneficial arrangements\u201d that could provide patients with better care at lower cost. Hospitals often say they want to reward doctors who meet certain goals for improving the health of patients, reducing the length of hospital stays and preventing readmissions. But federal courts have held that the anti-kickback statute can be violated if even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce referrals or generate business for the hospital. The premise of the kickback and self-referral laws is that health care providers should make medical decisions based on the needs of patients, not on the financial interests of doctors or other providers. Health care providers can be fined if they offer financial incentives to Medicare or Medicaid patients to use their services or products. Drug companies have been found to violate the law when they give kickbacks to pharmacies in return for recommending their drugs to patients. Hospitals can also be fined if they make payments to a doctor \u201cas an inducement to reduce or limit services\u201d provided to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary. Doctors, hospitals and drug companies are urging the Trump administration to provide broad legal protection \u2014 a \u201csafe harbor\u201d \u2014 for arrangements that promote coordinated, \u201cvalue-based care.\u201d In soliciting advice, the Trump administration said it wanted to hear about the possible need for \u201ca new exception to the physician self-referral law\u201d and \u201cexceptions to the definition of remuneration.\u201d Almost every week the Justice Department files another case against health care providers. Many of the cases were brought to the government\u2019s attention by people who say they saw the bad behavior while working in the industry. \u201cGood providers can work within the existing rules,\u201d said Joel M. Androphy, a Houston lawyer who has handled many health care fraud cases. \u201cThe only people I ever hear complaining are people who got caught cheating or are trying to take advantage of the system. It would be disgraceful to change the rules to appease the violators.\u201d But the laws are complex, and the stakes are high. A health care provider who violates the anti-kickback or self-referral law may face business-crippling fines under the False Claims Act and can be excluded from Medicare and Medicaid, a penalty tantamount to a professional death sentence for some providers. Federal law generally prevents insurers and health care providers from offering free or discounted goods and services to Medicare and Medicaid patients if the gifts are likely to influence a patient\u2019s choice of a particular provider. Hospital executives say the law creates potential problems when they want to offer social services, free meals, transportation vouchers or housing assistance to patients in the community. Likewise, drug companies say they want to provide financial assistance to Medicare patients who cannot afford their share of the bill for expensive medicines. AstraZeneca, the drug company, said that older Americans with drug coverage under Part D of Medicare \u201coften face prohibitively high cost-sharing amounts for their medicines,\u201d but that drug manufacturers cannot help them pay these costs. For this reason, it said, the government should provide legal protection for arrangements that link the cost of a drug to its value for patients. Even as health care providers complain about the broad reach of the anti-kickback statute, the Justice Department is aggressively pursuing violations. A Texas hospital administrator was convicted in October for his role in submitting false claims to Medicare for the treatment of people with severe mental illness. Evidence at the trial showed that he and others had paid kickbacks to \u201cpatient recruiters\u201d who sent Medicare patients to the hospital. The owner of a Florida pharmacy pleaded guilty last month for his role in a scheme to pay kickbacks to Medicare beneficiaries in exchange for their promise to fill prescriptions at his pharmacy. The Justice Department in April accused Insys Therapeutics of paying kickbacks to induce doctors to prescribe its powerful opioid painkiller for their patients. The company said in August that it had reached an agreement in principle to settle the case by paying the government $150 million. The line between patient assistance and marketing tactics is sometimes vague. This month, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services refused to approve a proposal by a drug company to give hospitals free vials of an expensive drug to treat a disorder that causes seizures in young children. The inspector general said this arrangement could encourage doctors to continue prescribing the drug for patients outside the hospital, driving up costs for consumers, Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/us/politics/trump-health-care-kickbacks-medicare-medicaid.html"},
{"title": "Mexico Mulls Allowing Migrants to Stay There Pending U.S. Asylum Bids", "description": "President Trump insists that no migrant will be admitted to the U.S. without an approved asylum claim, but Mexico counters that no deal has been reached.", "author": "By Azam Ahmed and Kirk Semple", "content": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Leaders of the incoming Mexican government are in talks with American officials to allow migrants applying for asylum in the United States to remain in Mexico while they await a decision \u2014 a drastic overhaul of current policy that President Trump suggested Saturday night was as good as a done deal. While Mexican officials said no decision has been made, leaders of the incoming government are under immense pressure to deal with thousands of migrants lined up along the border between the two countries. The top officials of the incoming administration plan to meet as early as Sunday to discuss the proposal, according to the new foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, who will take office on Dec. 1. A decision to allow the migrants to stay inside of Mexico while awaiting word from the United States courts would be a sharp reversal of the current policy, which allows asylum seekers to remain in the United States until their petition is resolved. The Trump administration has reviled this as a \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy that migrants often abuse by skipping court proceedings and vanishing inside the United States. The administration, which has bitterly complained that Congress has not addressed the issue, has been pressing the Mexican government for months to help. \u201cMigrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court. We only will allow those who come into our Country legally. Other than that our very strong policy is Catch and Detain. No \u2018Releasing\u2019 into the U.S \u2026\u201d Mr. Trump said in a tweet. \u201c \u2026 All will stay in Mexico. If for any reason it becomes necessary, we will CLOSE our Southern Border. There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with the costly and dangerous situation anymore!\u201d Mr. Trump added. Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that the policy could be rolled out as early as this coming week, though many logistical questions remained unanswered. The plan was also expected to face immediate legal challenges, which government lawyers were preparing to defend once it was formally announced. Over the last several months, the number of migrants at the border has surged as Central Americans and others fleeing violence and poverty are trapped in a processing bottleneck with American border officials. As thousands await entry to begin the asylum-seeking process, migrant shelters and local and state resources in Mexico have been overwhelmed. Discussions have been ongoing for several months on how to deal with the backlog. Mr. Ebrard said on Saturday that no decision had been reached about how to manage the crowds of migrants along the border. The issue has become more urgent in recent weeks as the number of migrants at certain border crossings has risen sharply. Many have traveled in caravan-style groups of a few thousand. In the past two weeks alone, some 5,000 migrants, mostly from Central America, have arrived in the northern Mexican border city of Tijuana. Officials say they expect at least another 1,500 to arrive in the coming days, some traveling in other caravans making their way north through Mexico. While many are economic migrants, fleeing poverty in their homeland, hundreds \u2014 if not more \u2014 said they intended to apply for asylum in the United States. On Friday, the mayor of Tijuana, Juan Manuel Gastelum, declared a humanitarian crisis in the city and said he would request assistance from the United Nations to ease the burden of sheltering, feeding and clothing the migrants. According to a United States official with knowledge of the proposal, migrants would come to the United States ports of entry to apply for asylum and be interviewed. If they can establish a credible fear of returning to their home countries, they would be given a court date and then return to Mexico to await that date. But because of the backlog in the immigration courts \u2014 about a million cases \u2014 these individuals would most likely wait for years in Mexico. \u201cWhat exists is a conversation about what do to with 9,000 people that are going to remain in Tijuana for a year,\u201d said Mr. Ebrard, who acknowledged the discussions were ongoing. \u201cWhat we are trying to think about is how to organize this, but we still have not found the response.\u201d Assistant United States Secretary of State Kimberly Breier said Saturday: \u201cOur engagement with Mexico is, first and foremost, based on mutual respect and on a commitment to work together to find creative solutions to our shared challenges. We continue to work closely with both the current and incoming Mexican governments on issues across the bilateral relationship, including illegal migration.\u201d Sunday\u2019s meeting is to include Mr. Ebrard; the incoming interior minister, Olga Sanchez Cordero, and other top officials in the government of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. News of the proposal was first reported by The Washington Post, which quoted Mrs. Sanchez Cordero as saying an agreement between the United States and the incoming Mexican government had been reached. But later Saturday, Mrs. Sanchez Cordero issued a statement saying that there was no decision regarding the use of Mexico as a holding area for asylum applicants to the United States. The Trump administration, eager to lower migration numbers and ease the burden on the American asylum system, had suggested turning Mexico into a so-called \u201csafe third country,\u201d which would require migrants who pass through there with the intention of applying for asylum in the United States to petition for sanctuary in Mexico instead. But the outgoing administration of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has resisted, as has its successor. \u201cWe still do not have a specific proposal from the United States,\u201d Mr. Ebrard said. \u201cWe are still against the safe third country, but this theme is something distinct and because of that, we are analyzing it with care.\u201d The plan under consideration would differ from the safe third country status, but ultimately it would mean many thousands more migrants remaining in Mexico while the United States processes them. Currently, migrants who can establish a credible fear of returning to their home countries are processed and released by the Department of Homeland Security pending a court date. The number of people traveling in families in recent months has surged, frustrating Mr. Trump, who made reducing illegal immigration a key plank of his 2016 election campaign. Last month, the number of people in families caught at the border exceeded 23,000, a record. In September, nearly 16,658 people in families were apprehended at the border, prompting the Trump administration to label the increase in migrants an unprecedented crisis and national security threat. Frustrated by the rise in migrant families, in April the administration began a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, criminally prosecuting anyone who crossed the border illegally. The enforcement of the policy led to the separation of nearly 3,000 children from their parents, setting off weeks of national protests, with Democrats and many Republicans calling on Mr. Trump to rescind the policy. He eventually relented and moved to halt the family separations, though the government struggled in some cases to reunite those it had already separated. Even before the current wave of migrant caravans began to arrive in Tijuana in mid-November, the border city, long a major migratory gateway to the United States, was already under stress. Because of a bottleneck in asylum processing at the American border crossings there, some 2,800 migrants were already in the city, with many of them filling Tijuana\u2019s migrant shelters. Wait times for some have stretched as long as two months. The Mexican asylum system is already overwhelmed by the growing numbers of immigrants who have sought sanctuary, and advocates contend that Mexico remains a dangerous place for migrants in transit or seeking to stay.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/americas/mexico-migrant-crisis.html"},
{"title": "Marijuana Legalization Threatens These Dogs\u2019 Collars", "description": "Drug-sniffing dogs that are trained to detect marijuana are complicating searches where pot has been legalized. That\u2019s forcing some into early retirement.", "author": "By Stacy Cowley", "content": "Officer Tulo will turn in his badge in January, forced into early retirement by the country\u2019s waning war on weed. In his eight years with the Police Department of Rifle, Colo., Tulo, a yellow Labrador retriever, has helped with more than 170 arrests in the town of 9,000. But one of his old-fashioned skills hasn\u2019t just fallen out of demand since the state legalized marijuana, it has become a liability: State court rulings mean that Tulo\u2019s keen nose for pot imperils his work on other drug cases. As states and cities loosen their drug laws, the highly trained dogs their police departments use to sniff out narcotics can\u2019t always be counted on to smell the right thing. \u201cA dog can\u2019t tell you, \u2018Hey, I smell marijuana\u2019 or \u2018I smell meth,\u2019\u201d said Tommy Klein, Rifle\u2019s police chief. \u201cThey have the same behavior for any drug that they\u2019ve been trained on. If Tulo were to alert on a car, we no longer have probable cause for a search based on his alert alone.\u201d Older canine workers across the country \u2014 and 14 narcotics dogs in Canada, where retail marijuana sales began last month \u2014 are being eased out of the labor force. When the Police Department in Winnipeg, Manitoba, went shopping this year for a pup, the Belgian Malinois they chose, named Ivy, arrived with a more modern advantage: She has no reaction to marijuana. In many places that have legalized the drug, including California, Oregon, Maine and Vermont, most new recruits are, like Ivy, no longer being trained to sniff out pot. And even departments in states where marijuana remains verboten are hedging their bets. \u201cI just did a dog for a department in Texas that asked me not to put marijuana on her,\u201d said Ron Cloward, the owner of Top Dog Police K-9 Training and Consulting in Modesto, Calif. \u201cThey had the feeling there could be some changes coming there, and they wanted to plan ahead.\u201d In Colorado, an appeals court ruling last year helped hasten Tulo\u2019s retirement. Kilo, a drug-detection dog in rural Moffat County, flagged a man\u2019s truck for containing contraband. When officers searched it, they found a pipe with what appeared to be methamphetamine residue. But Kilo was trained to find multiple drugs, including marijuana. Even though no marijuana was found in the truck, the three-judge panel said Kilo\u2019s signal was no longer a reliable indicator of illegal activity. The court ruled that officers therefore had no legal grounds to search the truck, and overturned the conviction.  The Colorado Supreme Court is reviewing the decision and plans to hear arguments next month. But some departments in the state aren\u2019t waiting to show their marijuana-trained dogs the door. Arvada, a community outside Denver, decided to retire one of its older dogs, Beaker, because of that case and other court rulings. Officer Brian Laas handed Beaker\u2019s duties over to Rudy, a younger dog that is trained to detect four illegal drugs \u2014 cocaine, heroin, Ecstasy and methamphetamine \u2014 but not marijuana. \u201cThis has been a really difficult thing for some of the smaller departments that can\u2019t afford to take out trained dogs,\u201d said Officer Laas, who is the president of the Colorado Police K-9 Association. Suitable dogs don\u2019t come cheap: It typically costs at least $6,000 to buy a working dog and thousands more to train it. A Rifle resident raised money on GoFundMe to buy the department two new Labrador puppies, Jax and Makai. \u201cThe community really came together and rallied to help us out,\u201d said Cpl. Garrett Duncan, Tulo\u2019s handler and partner. The laws and legal decisions around the use of drug dogs are something of a patchwork, leaving states grappling with what to do.  Some departments in states that have legalized marijuana have decided to keep their current dogs and take their chances in court, said David Ferland, the executive director of the United States Police Canine Association, a training and certification organization. Others have shifted their dogs\u2019 duties, using them only in places where marijuana remains off limits, like jails and schools. Many departments are trying to future-proof themselves by dropping marijuana from their training programs. \u201cAlmost every state is trying to get ahead of this,\u201d Mr. Ferland said. \u201cNearly every one is having some newly trained teams not introduce marijuana odors to their dogs.\u201d But some are holding out. In Kansas, which shares a border with Colorado, cannabis is still part of the curriculum for canine trainees. \u201cThe issue is on our radar, and we watch and research what states are doing as legalization crawls across the United States, but as of today all of our dogs are still imprinted on marijuana odor,\u201d said Chad McCluskey, the master trainer for the Kansas Police Dog Association. \u201cWe are not considering a change to that approach.\u201d Michigan, which this month became the 10th state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, is trying to figure out what to do with the 50 dogs used by its state police. \u201cWe\u2019re still reviewing the law\u2019s impact on our operations and determining next steps,\u201d said Lori Dougovito, a state police spokeswoman.  Part of the problem is that old dogs really do have a hard time learning new tricks. Experts including Mr. Ferland and Dave Smith, the head trainer at Ventosa Kennel, which sells trained dogs to police agencies nationwide, don\u2019t recommend retraining. Even if a dog can be trained to stop reacting to marijuana, there will be no way to prove the dog didn\u2019t slip up, Mr. Smith said. \u201cAny defense attorney is going to ask, \u2018Has your dog ever alerted to marijuana?\u2019\u201d he said. Even if marijuana legalization is putting some dogs out of a job, it\u2019s not putting them on the street. Retired dogs typically go home with their handlers and spend the rest of their lives as pets. When the idea of legalizing recreational marijuana in Illinois was floated last year by state lawmakers, one local sheriff \u2014 Howard Buffett, a son of Warren E. Buffett, the famed investor \u2014 said it would force the state\u2019s 275 narcotics dogs into early retirement. One police canine trainer suggested that many of the dogs would have to be euthanized, touching off a wave of criticism from astonished experts. The trainer\u2019s boss soon retracted the statement, calling it \u201ca bad choice of words.\u201d Canine officers were likewise appalled at the idea of their partners being put down. \u201cThey\u2019re our kids,\u201d said Officer Laas, the handler of Beaker and Rudy. \u201cWhen they\u2019re done working, we\u2019re going to make sure they\u2019re really well taken care of.\u201d When Tulo retires, he will continue to live with Corporal Duncan, who has promised him a life of hiking, camping and running around in Rifle\u2019s parks with the household\u2019s three other dogs. One of them is one of Tulo\u2019s replacements on the force, Makai. Like any veteran officer, Tulo gets annoyed with the rookies, Corporal Duncan said. And he doesn\u2019t seem quite ready for retirement, either. When Corporal Duncan went off to patrol on one recent workday and Tulo stayed behind, the bored dog retaliated by demolishing a full trash bin. \u201cHe\u2019s been in a cop car since he was a few months old, and he really likes the job,\u201d Corporal Duncan said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a bit frustrated about being left at home.\u201d", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/business/marijuana-legalization-police-dogs.html"},
{"title": "Ohio State Overwhelms Rival Michigan, Again", "description": "With a victory that puts them back in the Big Ten title game, the Buckeyes have now won 14 of their last 15 games against the Wolverines.", "author": "By Marc Tracy", "content": "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 There are no more original \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic strips, but every autumn there is a new version of the old chestnut where Lucy holds the football for Charlie Brown to kick, only to pull it away at the last moment. It is this: Ohio State letting Michigan think it can win their annual rivalry game \u2014 only to yank victory away for itself. The latest twist came Saturday afternoon, as Ohio State outlasted Michigan in the first half and then blew the door off its hinges in the second to overwhelm the Wolverines, 62-39. \u201cI knew we were going to come out and put on a show,\u201d said Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins Jr., a sophomore who is in his first season as the starter. But, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know about 62.\u201d The No. 10 Buckeyes improved to 11-1 and secured a date next Saturday in Indianapolis against No. 20 Northwestern (8-4) in the Big Ten championship game. Even with a win there, a berth in the four-team College Football Playoff is far from assured. But here is a fact: Ohio State has won 14 of the last 15 games in one of sport\u2019s most venerable rivalries, which has been played 114 times. No. 4 Michigan (10-2), in its fourth season under Coach Jim Harbaugh, entered the game as the higher-ranked team for the first time since its last victory, in 2011. Asked whether he knew that Ohio State had never before scored more than 50 points in the game, Harbaugh, a former Michigan quarterback, said: \u201cI believe I did, yes. And congratulations to them.\u201d This was a game the Wolverines were supposed to win. Their roster features the fruits of nationally elite recruiting. They defeated teams like Michigan State and Penn State, which had stubbornly stymied them in previous years. Their only other loss came by a touchdown in the season\u2019s first game, at Notre Dame, which is now 12-0 and ranked No. 3. Ohio State had lost by 29 to Purdue and barely survived Maryland and Nebraska, who were having so-so seasons. Before Saturday, the better-ranked team had won this game every year dating to 2003. Had Michigan won and then defeated Northwestern, it would most likely have been in contention for a national title for the first time since 1997. \u201cWe really wanted that win, but it didn\u2019t come as planned,\u201d Wolverines receiver Nico Collins, a sophomore, said. Ohio State\u2019s playoff chances remain unclear. Last week, the selection committee conspicuously ranked it below every other one-loss team in the Power 5 conferences, plus two-loss Louisiana State and Central Florida of the American Athletic Conference. That is not the only elephant in the Ohio State locker room, though. Offensive lineman Isaiah Prince referred after the game to \u201cso much criticism, going through so much adversity.\u201d During his news conference, Coach Urban Meyer got emotional when asked about seeing his family after the game. Questions have swirled about Meyer\u2019s future. His three national titles \u2014 including one at Ohio State (2014) \u2014 are second among active coaches to Alabama\u2019s Nick Saban. But he was suspended for the first three games of the season after a university report found that he had mishandled accusations of domestic violence against a longtime assistant, and in recent weeks he appeared to be in physical pain on the sideline as his team struggled. On Saturday, however, he seemed joyful as he greeted seniors before their final game at Ohio Stadium, waved his arms to exhort the crowd of more than 106,000 to make noise during Michigan third downs, and extended his record in the rivalry to 7-0. As it has all season, Michigan relied on huddles and handoffs up the middle. This old-school look worked when Michigan accompanied it with college football\u2019s best defense, sacrificing an average of 235 yards and 13.5 points per game entering Saturday. But on Saturday, the Wolverines gave up 24 points in just the first half. Ceding fewer than 4 yards per play before the game, they allowed Ohio State 8.5. Entering the game allowing fewer than 130 passing yards per game, they were shredded by the Buckeyes\u2019 air attack for 318. Averaging nearly three sacks per game, they got zero. Haskins said he expected, and got, one-on-one defenses that allowed him to hit speedy receivers on quick-drop crossing routes. The receivers then beat their defenders for yards after the catch. The strategy \u2014 paired with option plays in which Haskins was a threat to run or pass \u2014 allowed Ohio State to score three touchdowns on its first five possessions. Haskins completed 19 of 30 passes for 318 yards and five touchdowns. Nine Ohio State players caught passes. The freshman receiver Chris Olave caught two touchdowns \u2014 the first of his college career \u2014 and blocked a punt that led to a third. Ohio State\u2019s halftime lead of 24-19 was that close only after a fumbled Ohio State kickoff reception with less than a minute left led to a Michigan recovery and a quick touchdown. By late in the third quarter, the game was a boxing match begging for a referee to call it. First, Wolverines quarterback Shea Patterson \u2014 who finished 20 of 34 for 187 yards and three touchdowns \u2014 failed to connect with tight end Zach Gentry on an open third-down pass, and on the next play Olave blocked Michigan\u2019s punt, the ball falling into the hands of Sevyn Banks as he streaked toward the end zone. (Gentry left the game with a concussion and Patterson sustained a bone bruise, Harbaugh said.) That made it 34-19. Later in the third, Patterson threw an easy interception on third down deep in Michigan territory, setting up a Buckeyes score that made it 41-19. Early in the fourth quarter, Ohio State\u2019s Parris Campbell Jr. ran for a 78-yard touchdown: 48-25. Collins, the Michigan receiver, spoke hopefully but appeared bereft when asked to explain how the game had gone. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bright future ahead of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see \u2019em every year. Hopefully next year, we can get that win.\u201d", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/sports/ohio-state-michigan-big-ten.html"},

The Islanders defeated the visiting Hurricanes, 4-1.", "author": "By The Associated Press", "content": "Patrik Laine scored five goals Saturday in the Winnipeg Jets\u2019 8-4 victory in St. Louis, two short of the 97-year-old N.H.L. record. It was the 61st five-goal game in league history, and Laine became the third player since the 1997-98 season to score five goals in a game and the first since Johan Franzen did it for the Detroit Red Wings on Feb. 2, 2011. Marian Gaborik did it with the Minnesota Wild in 2007. Joe Malone, who played in the early days of the N.H.L. with the Montreal Canadiens, scored seven goals in a game with the Quebec Bulldogs in January 1920. Darryl Sittler of the Toronto Maple Leafs was the last player to score six goals in a game, on April 22, 1976, against Boston. \u201cIf somebody thinks that it\u2019s going to come easily, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Laine said. \u201cEvery goal you\u2019re going to score in this league, it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s the best league in the world. Obviously scoring five, it\u2019s pretty unreal, but for those who think it\u2019s easy, it\u2019s not.\u201d Brandon Tanev, Blake Wheeler, and Jack Roslovic also scored for the Jets, who snapped their first two-game losing streak of the season. Laine\u2019s five goal outburst gives him a league-leading 16 goals in 10 November games. \u201cI felt like every time I touched the puck, it kind of went in somehow,\u201d he said. Chad Johnson allowed six goals on 25 shots and was pulled in favor of Jake Allen after allowing his sixth goal, Laine\u2019s fourth. Allen stopped nine of 11 shots. Laine scored his first goal 16 minutes 26 seconds into the first period when he buried a feed from Bryan Little just 41 seconds after Wheeler tied the game at 1-1 with his fourth goal of the season. Vladimir Tarasenko tied the game 1:24 later when he snapped a 10-game streak without scoring a goal with his seventh of the season. Laine\u2019s second goal came on the power play with Tarasenko serving a two-minute penalty for roughing and put Winnipeg ahead, 3-2. Laine completed his seventh career hat trick and third of November when he beat Johnson 12:53 into the third period. Blues defenseman Joel Edmundson fought Tyler Myers shortly after Laine\u2019s third goal, but that did nothing to change the tide as Laine netted his fourth goal later in the period. Laine netted his fifth of the game when he pushed a feed from Little past Allen, becoming the 45th player in N.H.L. history to record a five-goal game. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play him harder,\u201d Blues left wing David Perron said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we respected him too much.\u201d CAPITALS 5, RANGERS 3 Brett Connolly scored the tiebreaking goal on a one-timer from the left circle with 6:24 left in the third period, and Washington beat the host Rangers for their season-high fifth straight win. \u201cA little bit of open ice,\u201d Connolly said of his fourth goal of the season. He added, \u201cI got a good piece of it, and it went right where I wanted it.\u201d Alex Ovechkin, Nic Dowd, Jakub Vrana and Tom Wilson also scored for the defending Stanley Cup champion Capitals, and Carlson had three assists. Pheonix Copley, starting in goal in place of Braden Holtby, stopped 27 shots. \u201cGood team win, we\u2019re playing really well as of late,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get that feeling again through our room, like we had toward the end of last year.\u201d The Capitals, who have rallied after giving up the first goal in four of their wins during their streak, trailed by 1-0 after one period and by two midway through the second before scoring three straight to take the lead heading to the third. \u201cWe\u2019re always believing we\u2019re in games,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cWe\u2019re finding ways to win.\u201d Ryan Strome tied the score, 3-3, on a wraparound at 5:30 of the final period \u2014 his first goal with the Rangers since being acquired from Edmonton on Nov. 16. Connolly, who also had an assist, then gave Washington the lead back, and Wilson added an empty-netter with 1:08 left for his fourth. Wilson has nine points in seven games since returning from a season-opening suspension that sidelined him for 16 games. Jimmy Vesey and Brady Skjei also scored for the Rangers, who lost their second straight and saw their seven-game home winning streak end. Kevin Hayes had two assists, and Alexandar Georgiev finished with 23 saves. Trailing, 1-0, after Vesey scored, the Capitals came out with increased intensity in the second period and scored three goals, outshooting the Rangers by 15-9. \u201cYou can\u2019t take a period off against anyone, let alone the defending Stanley Cup champions,\u201d Rangers Coach David Quinn said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a chance to beat them, you\u2019re going to have to stay on them for 60 minutes. You can have lapses where you don\u2019t play well, but they can\u2019t be 20-minute lapses.\u201d ISLANDERS 4, HURRICANES 1 Thomas Greiss made 26 saves, and Valtteri Filppula, Anthony Beauvillier, Josh Bailey and Adam Pelech scored, leading the host Islanders past Carolina. Brock Nelson, Anders Lee and Bailey finished with multipoint games. It was the sixth multipoint game of the season for Bailey. Justin Williams scored for the Hurricanes, and Scott Darling made 15 saves. The Islanders limited the Hurricanes to one goal for the third consecutive game. The win was the Islanders\u2019 second in a row against a divisional opponent on back-to-back nights. The Islanders are 9-1-0 against Metropolitan Division opponents. \u201cWe know the importance when it comes to playoff seeding, it\u2019s obviously crucial,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI think going into any game you have to get fired up and have preparation.

Mr. Roeg maintained that the seeming challenge wasn\u2019t all that formidable. \u201cThe fact is that Jagger, Bowie and Garfunkel are all extremely bright, intelligent and well educated,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1980. \u201cA long way from the public stereotype.\u201d If Mr. Roeg was known for casting rock stars, he also made an impression with one particular sex scene, in the 1973 film \u201cDon\u2019t Look Now,\u201d about a grieving couple played by Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. The scene, which featured lots of crosscutting, was graphic for the time \u2014 so much so that as recently as this year Mr. Sutherland still felt compelled to deny persistent rumors that the sex in it was not simulated. \u201cThe takes were 15 seconds long, maximum,\u201d he told The Daily News. Nicolas Jack Roeg was born on Aug. 15, 1928, in London to Jack and Mabel (Silk) Roeg. He did not attend film school, instead entering the business at the bottom in 1947, making tea and operating the clapperboard at Marylebone Studios in London. He worked his way up to camera operator and then cinematographer, receiving the director of photography credit on films like Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d and Richard Lester\u2019s \u201cA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,\u201d both in 1966. He also shot Mr. Lester\u2019s \u201cPetulia\u201d (1968), which featured the jump cuts and leaps in time that would be among Mr. Roeg\u2019s signatures. \u201cPerformance,\u201d his first directing credit, was completed in the late 1960s but shelved because Warner Brothers had misgivings about it. Some critics savaged it when it was finally released, but its reputation grew over time. In 1999 it made the British Film Institute\u2019s list of the 100 best British movies ever made, as did \u201cDon\u2019t Look Now.\u201d \u201cWalkabout,\u201d Mr. Roeg\u2019s first solo directing credit, released in 1971, told the story of a teenage girl and her brother who were abandoned in the Australian desert and are befriended by a young Aborigine. Mr. Roeg was his own cinematographer on the film. \u201cRoeg uses the camera \u2014 wide shots, close-ups, colors and textures \u2014 to create a sense of unmediated perception,\u201d A. O. Scott of The Times said of the film in a 2010 reassessment, \u201cas if we were seeing the world for the very first time.\u201d \u201cThe Man Who Fell to Earth\u201d further enhanced Mr. Roeg\u2019s reputation for making challenging, visually adventurous films. \u201cYou could call Roeg a pretentious director, but he is a gifted one, and many of his pretensions pay off in beauty, tension and a mysterious, unsettling power,\u201d Jack Kroll wrote in reviewing the movie in Newsweek. \u201c \u2018The Man Who Fell to Earth\u2019 has enough of these qualities to offset a sometimes maddeningly oblique style.\u201d Mr. Roeg, whose first marriage, to Susan Stephen in 1957, ended in divorce, married his lead actress from \u201cBad Timing,\u201d Theresa Russell, in 1982. She also appeared in several of his other films, including \u201cEureka\u201d (1983), \u201cInsignificance\u201d (1985) and \u201cTrack 29\u201d (1988). Also among his later films was \u201cThe Witches\u201d (1990). \u201cThis tale about a witches\u2019 plot to turn every child in England into a mouse is based on the novel by Roald Dahl, who does not write sugarcoated books,\u201d Caryn James wrote in her review in The Times. \u201cIt was directed by Nicolas Roeg, best known for the wonderfully terrifying \u2018Don\u2019t Look Now\u2019 and the deeply strange \u2018The Man Who Fell to Earth,\u2019 with David Bowie as an alien. As it turns out, Mr. Roeg is just the right match for this macabre and funny idea.\u201d Mr. Roeg\u2019s marriage to Ms. Russell ended in divorce. In 2005 he married Harriet Harper, who survives him. In addition to her and Nicholas Jr., he is survived by several other children. Complete information on survivors wasn\u2019t immediately available. In 1988, Jay Carr, film critic for The Boston Globe, summarized Mr. Roeg\u2019s style. \u201cThe characters in Nicolas Roeg\u2019s films live in their fantasies, and so does Roeg\u2019s camera,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe delights in juxtaposing their imaginings with so-called real life, sharing the confusion, making it universal.\u201d Among the directors Mr. Roeg influenced was Edgar Wright (\u201cBaby Driver\u201d). \u201cHis films hypnotized me for years and still continue to intrigue,\u201d Mr. Wright wrote on Twitter. \u201cAlong with classics like \u2018Performance\u2019 and \u2018Walkabout,\u2019 I could watch \u2018Don\u2019t Look Now\u2019 on a loop and never tire of its intricacies.\u2019\u201d", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/obituaries/nicolas-roeg-dead.html"},

The boat overturned and sank about 7 p.m. Saturday, said a senior police officer, Zurah Ganyana. She said that 27 people were rescued overnight. Officials said the death toll was expected to rise. Officials said the boat had been taking passengers on a pleasure cruise, a popular weekend activity for young people in Kampala, but it capsized close to shore. Officer Ganyana said the boat had been in poor condition and had been grounded for some time. She said it did not have a valid license to operate. Early Sunday, a police helicopter hovered low over the spot where the boat sank, as a team of divers searched for bodies under calm waters. A crowd of onlookers stood on a beach and watched the rescue and recovery efforts. The police carried victims\u2019 bodies in tarpaulins to a truck, occasionally drawing loud wails from some of the onlookers. One young woman, seeing a victim she apparently recognized, collapsed and was take to the hospital. The couple who owned the boat were believed to be among the victims, according Officer Ganyana. Witnesses who were there on Saturday night said they had heard people calling for help as they tried to stay afloat and saw others trying to swim ashore. Many were women. \u201cThey were shouting, \u2018Help us! Help us!\u2019 and the boat was sinking very quickly,\u201d said Sam Tukei, one of several local men who used fishermen\u2019s canoes to rescue people. \u201cBy the time the police came, we had saved many people.\u201d One reason many people died so close to shore was likely because of \u201cintoxication,\u201d said Asuman Mugenyi, the national director of police operations. Citing the accounts of some survivors, he said there had been a good number of life jackets aboard the doomed vessel that passengers did not wear. The boat\u2019s passengers most likely panicked when the vessel started to sink, he said. Boat accidents are increasingly common on East Africa\u2019s major lakes, including Lake Victoria, which is surrounded by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. More than 200 people were killed in September after a dangerously overcrowded Tanzanian ferry capsized, officials said.", "date": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/africa/uganda-party-boat-lake-victoria.html"},

Mexico gets a new president. And the Fed publishes a report on potential economic \u201cvulnerabilities.\"", "author": "By Charlotte Cowles", "content": "Hello! Welcome to With Interest. For those of you joining us for the first time, this Sunday newsletter contains the most important business and tech news, highlighting the essentials from the past week and what\u2019s in store for the next. Tell friends they can sign up here. Let\u2019s get started. Cyber Week is upon us, and if you want to be part of a national trend, don\u2019t even leave your kitchen: For the time ever, Americans are expected to buy more holiday goods via mobile device than computer or (heaven forbid) leaving the house for a brick-and-mortar store. So take a bite of leftovers, flex your thumbs and help break some spending records \u2014 sales in the United States are predicted to top $1 trillion this year. Just make sure you\u2019ve got a napkin handy. Your screen doesn\u2019t want any cranberry sauce. The economy may be soaring, but the stock market is getting airsick. A brutal midweek sell-off added up to a collective $800 billion in value lost by the tech giants Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet. (The S&P 500 was down 3.8 percent, one of its worst performances ever during a Thanksgiving week.) Analysts attribute the turbulence to President Trump\u2019s global trade conflicts, a tightening labor market and rising interest rates, all of which threaten corporate profits. It may also be a sign that we\u2019re headed for an inevitable slowdown in growth, ending one of the longest bull markets in history.  In a written statement packed with exclamation points, Mr. Trump pledged his support for Saudi Arabia despite the C.I.A.\u2019s conclusion that the country\u2019s de facto ruler ordered the grisly murder of an American resident, the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr. Trump cited United States-Saudi economic interests, including a $110 billion arms deal and $340 billion in other promised investments, although those numbers were quickly contested by experts. Mr. Trump also thanked Saudi Arabia for keeping a lid on oil prices and Iranian power. Critics say the president is emboldening a dangerous regime, while others say his strategy \u2014 while morally repugnant \u2014 is a pragmatic one. Carlos Ghosn started the week as chairman of Nissan, chief executive of Renault and chairman of the board at Mitsubishi. But since his arrest in Tokyo on Monday for financial misconduct \u2014 over allegations that he underreported his pay package by almost half \u2014 Mr. Ghosn has been removed as chairman of Nissan and will probably remain in custody for a while. A larger-than-life figure (he rented out Versailles for his 2016 wedding), Mr. Ghosn is known in France as \u201cle cost killer.\u201d The alliance he engineered between Nissan and Renault effectively created the world\u2019s largest carmaker, and his downfall leaves a gaping vacuum in an industry that\u2019s already faltering under trade tensions and shifting consumer demands. Mr. Trump will face off \u2014 er, gather \u2014 this week with world leaders at the annual conference of the Group of 20 nations. On the docket: a meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, with whom he recently crossed paths (and exchanged public smiles) in Paris, as well as talks with President Xi Jinping of China, who will presumably not be smiling. The prospects for a trade truce between the United States and China do not look good, and other nations are feeling heat to pick sides. At the recent Pacific Rim trade summit, officials from the two countries argued so bitterly that no resolution could be reached \u2014 a first in the conference\u2019s three-decade history. The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday will publish its first-ever Financial Stability Report, a new assessment of the country\u2019s potential \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d based on financial data like bank loans and household borrowing. Announced earlier this month, the report will be issued twice a year from now on. The central bank is also mulling changes to the annual stress tests it has imposed on the country\u2019s biggest banks since the 2008 financial crisis. Separately, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates again in December, despite pressure from Mr. Trump. On Dec. 1, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador will be inaugurated as president of Mexico, succeeding Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Known as AMLO, the incoming leader is Mexico\u2019s first leftist president in decades, and has already become the object of widespread denunciation for inviting Nicolas Maduro, the embattled president of Venezuela, to his swearing-in. (Vice President Mike Pence will also attend.) Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s trade deal with Canada and Mexico so that he can focus on his own country\u2019s flagging economy, but the two presidents may be headed for a showdown over immigration, a topic on which they do not agree, to put it mildly. David\u2019s Bridal, the country\u2019s largest wedding retailer, has filed for bankruptcy protection \u2014 but don\u2019t worry! Brides will still get their dresses. Also, Taylor Swift signed with Universal Music Group\u2019s Republic Records for an undisclosed amount after parting with her previous label of 12 years, Big Machine Records. And now, another reason to envy French women: A new law takes aim at the gender pay gap in France by requiring companies to report how much they pay female and male employees. If there\u2019s a discrepancy, the company has three years to fix it, or else they\u2019ll face a fine of 1 percent of their total payroll. 22 million: The number of Chinese citizens who could be \u201cpunished\u201d by Beijing\u2019s new rating system, which will track and score the city\u2019s population based on their \u201csocial credit\u201d by 2021.

{"title": "Early-Season Surprises From the Wacky N.B.A.", "description": "The drama has come faster than usual this season, from fistfights to free agents to sneakerheads grabbing the spotlight.", "author": "By Sopan Deb", "content": "It has taken an unusual amount of ink, focus, caffeine and pregame napping to stay on top of all the drama in the N.B.A. this season. Without a running diary, it would be easy to forget that the Oklahoma City Thunder did not win their first game for 12 days, or that Blake Griffin scored 50 points against Philadelphia, or that Luke Walton\u2019s run with the Los Angeles Lakers as coach once seemed to be in its final days. Only a fraction of the way through this season, a crew of New York Times sportswriters and friends are ready to reflect. Here are their early-season takeaways: The Boston Celtics could have four first-rounders in next year\u2019s draft, from: the Kings (top 1 protected), the Grizzlies (1 to 8 protected) and the Clippers (1 to 14 protected), plus their own. We are almost a quarter of the way through the season. Who would have thought that the Celtics would be on track to end up the highest pick of them all by season\u2019s end? I\u2019m being hyperbolic. But we\u2019re past the \u201cit\u2019s early\u201d stage to assess the team, and the results are disappointing. Boston lost at home against a terrible Knicks team. Before that, there was a blown double-digit, fourth-quarter lead against a tired Charlotte Hornets team. It\u2019s nothing short of baffling. One of their wins required an unlikely, otherworldly late comeback against an objectively bad Phoenix team. And it\u2019s not like the Celtics are the only team that has had to incorporate players into new roles. Brad Stevens\u2019s offense moves the ball well (in the top half of the league in assist percentage) and generates open looks with ease. It\u2019s not a lethargy thing, either: The players seem to like playing with one another and for Stevens. And besides, how do you have one of the league\u2019s best defenses without playing hard? But the open looks just aren\u2019t falling, and neither are the shots around the paint, in the rare instances players actually try to go to the rim. The offense is designed to emphasize the shooting talent of the roster. Everyone has some semblance of a jumper. In today\u2019s N.B.A., this should, in theory, make for a lethal offense. Early on, it was easy to say the bricks were a bug, not a feature. Now you have to wonder if there\u2019s more going on here. Boston shoots under 35 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, well below the league average. When the open looks have not fallen, Boston has not found alternatives. The Celtics are near the bottom of the league in drives to the rim per game, which you can get away with if the offense is hitting its jumpers, which it\u2019s not. And when the ball finds its way into the paint, in the restricted area, the Celtics shoot 61 percent, also below mediocre. And then there\u2019s Gordon Hayward, who clearly still needs time. I expected his explosiveness to the rim to need the time, not his 3-point shooting, which is mired at 28 percent. The lesson: Don\u2019t trust all those off-season workout videos you see of players swishing shots. So those are the worrying signs. The positives? The talent is there. And this is with Kyrie Irving playing some of the best ball of his career. After a slow start, he is shooting nearly 50 percent from the field and is top 10 in real plus-minus. Jayson Tatum is pulling out of his  slump, shooting 45 percent from the field in November, compared with 40 percent in October. You have to believe that Jaylen Brown is better than the 37 percent he is shooting from the field. Boston has pulled out some big wins against other Eastern Conference powers: Toronto, Philadelphia and Milwaukee. I\u2019m still betting on Boston to go to the N.B.A. finals because Stevens is a master at adjustments and, frankly, in this league, talented players in their prime win. But if the mediocrity continues, I have to wonder if Danny Ainge will end up regretting not moving more aggressively to trade Brown for Kawhi Leonard. And the biggest positive: Look at all those draft picks next year, if things don\u2019t work out! The N.B.A.\u2019s California contingent has gone mad. The two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors are dealing with \u2014 dare I say it? \u2014 some dysfunction. The Los Angeles Lakers and their cast of misfit toys are suddenly surging behind the one and only LeBron James. The Los Angeles Clippers, whom few expected to even vie for a playoff spot, are shaping up as one of the more dangerous teams in the Western Conference. And the Sacramento Kings \u2014 well, at least the Kings are still the Kings, reportedly rived by front-office drama. Out here in California, where I relocated for the season, up is down, left is right and not a whole lot makes sense, starting with the Warriors, whom I visited toward the end of October. At the time, their season was going well, which was no surprise. I wrote about how they were having lots of fun, months removed from a championship season that apparently had its share of behind-the-scenes agita. But they were enjoying themselves again, and get this: Draymond Green said he had made it a goal to stop complaining to the referees so much. My article did not age well. A kinder, gentler Green proceeded to blow up in Kevin Durant\u2019s face earlier this month, and the fallout has been something to behold. The Warriors have lost a bunch of games. Stephen Curry has been sidelined with an injury. And questions continue to swirl about Durant\u2019s future with the team, with free agency looming this summer. I think it\u2019s fair to say that no one could have predicted this sort of drama playing out in Oakland. And while I would be shocked to see the Warriors continue to struggle \u2014 awesome talent tends to compensate for a multitude of sins \u2014 the past couple of weeks have illustrated the fragile nature of team chemistry, even when that team is an established superpower. Speaking of superpowers, James is doing it again: elevating an odd collection of inexperienced players and reclamation projects into something that resembles a contender, or at least a competitive team. Not so long ago, Rajon Rondo was trying to deck Chris Paul of the Houston Rockets, and Magic Johnson, the team president, was yelling at Coach Luke Walton, raising concerns about Walton\u2019s job security. But the Lakers now look pretty cohesive compared with the Warriors, and who saw that coming? James, of course, deserves a lot of the credit. Approaching 34 and in his 16th season, he is playing some of the finest basketball of his career. The Clippers, too, have been exciting to watch. They have ferocious defenders and players who know their roles, and they are going about their business their own way: without a resident superstar, proving there might just be more than one way to win in the modern N.B.A. It might not work for the Philadelphia 76ers. Jimmy Butler might bolt after the season. He might further erode Markelle Fultz\u2019s confidence. He might not be good enough to be the second-best player on a championship team. But good for the 76ers for finally pushing their chips into the middle of the table and going for it. This isn\u2019t an anti-Process rant, or at least not entirely one. It is a plea for a more realistic understanding of the typical development path and of how few young players actually become stars. Every team eventually has a young player whom fans overhype, who is sure to be a star and whom the team refuses to trade. For Golden State Warriors fans like me, that player was Anthony Randolph, who promised to be a hybrid of Lamar Odom and Kevin Garnett. In six N.B.A. seasons, Randolph started just 43 games and averaged 7.1 points. For Mavericks fans, that player was Rodrigue Beaubois. Declared \u201cuntouchable\u201d by Mark Cuban, he lasted four seasons in the league. Fultz, Lonzo Ball and Jayson Tatum \u2014 the top three picks in last year\u2019s draft \u2014 are all struggling. So is Donovan Mitchell, the rookie of the year runner-up. At the same time, De\u2019Aaron Fox and Zach Collins are impressing after pedestrian rookie seasons. All of this is to say that young players are tough to evaluate, and the overwhelming majority of them do not become stars. From the 2013 draft there is Giannis Antetokounmpo and maybe Victor Oladipo. From 2014 there is Joel Embiid. From 2015 there are none yet, unless you\u2019re willing to bet the farm on Karl-Anthony Towns or Kristaps Porzingis. If Philadelphia flames out in the playoffs, Butler leaves and Dario Saric turns into a star, the 76ers will look dumb. But the far greater sin is passing on the opportunity to acquire a star in the hope that your young player will develop into one. The cynics will tell you there is little reason to follow the N.B.A. regular season. Not before Christmas, anyway. As an N.B.A. addict, I love it when the cynics are forced to stuff it. We\u2019re roughly one-fourth of the way into the 82-game schedule and the Golden State Warriors were on a very mortal 52-win pace entering Friday\u2019s play. They\u2019re hardly running away with things, as so many feared, and there has been a corresponding stream of surprises across the league. We might have already seen the biggest in-season blockbuster trade we\u2019re going to get with Jimmy Butler\u2019s Nov. 12 move from Minnesota to Philadelphia. We\u2019ve sadly seen Carmelo Anthony\u2019s stint as a Houston Rocket fizzle out faster than could be expected. And we\u2019ve seen an offensive eruption that has quickly generated five 50-point games \u2014 and a 60-pointer by Charlotte guard Kemba Walker \u2014 after just 10 50-point games total last season. The big-picture geek in me, meanwhile, can\u2019t stop checking the standings every day \u2014 even at this early stage \u2014 because of the unforeseen chaos in both conferences. In the resurgent East: Toronto, Milwaukee and Philadelphia are playing better than Boston, which means the Celtics will not be getting that supposed free pass to the N.B.A. finals. The unexpected battle for a top-four seeding \u2014 go ahead and throw the pesky Indiana Pacers into the conversation, too \u2014 has hushed the notion that this conference should just cease to exist after LeBron James\u2019s relocation to Hollywood. Out west, meanwhile, Portland, Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers are overachieving, thus offsetting the so-so starts endured by the more established likes of Houston, Utah and San Antonio. The rules haven\u2019t changed; only eight teams in each conference can advance to the playoffs. But take a look at the ever-deep West ladder and you\u2019ll see only one team of 15 \u2014 Phoenix \u2014 that can be dismissed as noncompetitive. How many wins is it going to take to secure a playoff berth in the West? Are we still sure that LeBron\u2019s Lakers will be one of those eight teams? Does the biggest threat to Golden State\u2019s bid for just the sixth three-peat in N.B.A. history \u2014 besides the Warriors themselves \u2014 reside in the West or the East? Maybe we\u2019ll be able to offer a clearer forecast on how to answer these nagging questions when we get to the regular-season midpoint in January. Then again, given the rampant script defiance we\u2019ve seen throughout #thisleague so far, maybe not. When the N.B.A. changed its rule before the season allowing players to wear whatever color shoes they want, sneakerheads rejoiced. Six weeks into the season, this is what that the color change has wrought: In the season opener, Houston Rockets forward P.J. Tucker, the reigning \u201cSneaker Champ\u201d (there is such a thing), wore three different pairs. One was a black and purple Nike Kobe 1, which he had signed by Kobe Bryant. A kaleidoscope of yellow ocher, Cinnamon Toast Crunch (part of Kyrie Irving\u2019s cereal pack) and green Grinch took center stage. Amid this color burst, there were floral patterns from a Chinese line, a pair inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog and a shoe featuring a cartoon version of Rosa Parks on its heel \u2014 as if we needed more proof that the N.B.A. is much more fun than its stodgy pro counterparts. Arguably the coolest line of kicks belongs to Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie, who will wear a different sneaker to every game. For the Nets\u2019 game against the 76ers on Sunday, he will debut his Creed shoe, a nod to Rocky\u2019s roots and the release of the movie \u201cCreed II.\u201d Dinwiddie unveiled a media shoe, a sneaker close to our heart, in the Nets\u2019 home opener against the Knicks. It thanked news organizations for their hard work. (Really!) It featured the logos of ESPN, NBA TV, Bleacher Report, The New York Post and The New York Times among others. Against Detroit, he wore the shoes honoring Rosa Park. After the Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee died, Dinwiddie called an audible and helped design a tribute shoe. His brand, K8IROS, has honored other sports and entertainment legends, with sneakers inspired by Colin Kaepernick, Prince, Muhammad Ali, Allen Iverson and Jesse Owens, to be auctioned off for charity. Signature shoes have long been a benchmark of success in the league, but Dinwiddie thinks what he\u2019s doing \u2014 along with the loosened N.B.A. rules \u2014 may lead to even more fun on the court. \u201cIt would be dope to see everyone try their hand at it and express themselves the way they want to express themselves,\u201d he said.", "date": "2018-11-22 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/sports/nba-early-season-surprises.html"},

It is all so vibrant, so alive \u2014 the sight of tens of thousands of fans mounting a pilgrimage just to see their team train; the sound of 70,000 in full voice, basking in glorious sunshine, hours before a game; the smell of the cordite; the smoke of the flares. But what makes the scene so mesmerizing \u2014 at least to the weary eyes of a European, or a North American, resigned to the corporatization of sport \u2014 is the sense that this is something that we have lost, or that this is how it should be. Those images are true, of course: Argentine soccer is vivid, pulsating with life in a way that, certainly in Europe, seems to have been condemned to the past. The stadiums shake with the noise, and the country with the fever of its obsession. It is true that Buenos Aires had been waiting with bated breath for a game it viewed as the most important in its history \u2014 the second leg of the Copa Libertadores final between River Plate and Boca Juniors, this city\u2019s, this country\u2019s and this continent\u2019s two biggest clubs. It is true that so many fans went to watch Boca train on Thursday that the City Council \u2014 angered that they had exceeded the stadium\u2019s capacity \u2014 decided to close it. It is true that almost as many went to La Boca again on Saturday to wave their team off. It is true that, on a warm, sunny morning, everyone seemed to be wearing the colors of their team. And it is true that passion turned to mayhem Saturday afternoon, forcing a postponement of an event that felt unique: the first time the two rivals of the so-called Supercl\u00e1sico were meeting to decide the most significant competition on the South American calendar: the Final to End All Finals, the Final for All Time, La Final\u00edsima. This is the other side, one that is off-putting rather than seductive. It is not unique to Argentina, not at all, but few countries struggle with it to such an extent. The trouble is not a direct consequence of those things that make Argentine soccer so appealing, but it is a result of allowing them to slip from control, to let them be used as justification for anything. And, to Argentina, it is a source of shame that on Saturday night, it showed that side to the world. As Boca Juniors\u2019 bus approached Estadio Monumental a couple of hours before kickoff, it turned down Avenida Monroe, a well-known gathering spot for River fans before games and not, as a rule, the route a visiting team would take. It was traveling quickly, flanked by police outriders. But as it slowed to turn a corner, the bus was confronted by hundreds of River fans. They threw stones, sticks and bottles. The windows shattered. The driver fainted. A Boca vice president, Horacio Paolini, had to take the wheel. The police, according to several reports, fired pepper spray to disperse the crowd. It drifted inside the bus. A few moments later, Boca arrived at the stadium, its players coughing, retching, their throats burning from the gas. Shards of glass had hit two players, Pablo P\u00e9rez and Gonzalo Lamardo, in the eye. Others had been cut by the debris. \u201cWe had come to play a game, and we found a completely different situation,\u201d said Marcelo London, a Boca official. Boca immediately requested that the game be canceled or postponed. Conmebol, the competition organizer, demurred. It had a commitment to its broadcaster, Fox Sports. The Argentine government, with a summit meeting of the G20 to start in Buenos Aires this week, wanted this match out of the way. The game was delayed once, then twice, then a third time. Viewers around the world waited, left in the dark as to what was happening. Outside, fans without tickets broke down barriers and battled with the police to get inside. P\u00e9rez and Lamardo were taken to a hospital for treatment; they were assessed, too, by Conmebol\u2019s own medical staff, who determined that their injuries were insufficient to warrant a cancellation. \u201cThe presidents of FIFA and Conmebol are making us play,\u201d Carlos Tevez, the Boca striker, said during the delay. Even the intervention of Marcelo Gallardo, the River manager, was insufficient. He had told Conmebol that if Boca did not want to play, then neither did River. The organization stood firm. \u201cThe truth is, we are not in a condition to play,\u201d Tevez said. \u201cWe are waiting.\u201d They waited until just before 7:45 p.m. in Buenos Aires, the last suggested kickoff time. River\u2019s coaching staff had laid out cones on the field, ready for the warm-up. Fans had started singing again. Then, at last, Conmebol made the announcement. The game was off, postponed until Sunday, 5 p.m. Argentina time. A few hours later, the Buenos Aires Council confirmed that it had closed the Monumental. Rodolfo D\u2019Onofrio and Daniel Angelici, the presidents of River and Boca, had reached a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d not to play, said the president of Conmebol, Alejandro Dominguez. \u201cOne did not want to play, and the other did not want to win in these circumstances,\u201d he said. The fans whistled at the decision. As they left, some fought running battles with the police. It would be easy to suggest that all of the hyperbole in the buildup to the game had almost guaranteed that this would happen. Passion had been pushed to a breaking point. This was the result of all of the talk, all of the hysteria, around the Final to End All Finals. And yet that is not real, either, or not all of reality. On Wednesday, All Boys, a second-division team in the Floresta neighborhood of Buenos Aires, lost its own cl\u00e1sico, against Atlanta, on a late goal. Its fans rioted, threatening Atlanta players on the field and fighting the police outside the stadium. River\u2019s meeting with Boca in the final of the Copa Libertadores might be unique, but the poison that devoured it is not. It has happened all too often here, of course; it is why since 2013 visiting fans have been barred from games involving Argentina\u2019s biggest teams. It is why so many dreaded this weekend, even as they shivered in anticipation of it. \u201cThis country is not ready for a Boca-River final,\u201d the journalist Andres Burgo said before the first leg, which ended in a 2-2 draw. They are used to it, resigned to it, imprisoned by it. The difference on Saturday was the scale of the audience. For once, Argentina felt the world was watching. \u201cAnother opportunity lost in front of the whole planet,\u201d Gabriel Batistuta, a former Argentina striker, wrote on Twitter. \u201cShameful. Lamentable.\u201d This is the reality of Argentine soccer. The color, the noise, that stirring sense of the epic: All of that is real. But it does not exist in isolation. Left unchecked \u2014 or more than that, indulged \u2014 it stops being a sign of something that is intensely alive. It starts to symbolize something that is being allowed to die.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/sports/boca-juniors-river-plate-copa-libertadores.html"},

Medical officials suspected chlorine had been used.", "author": "By Ben Hubbard", "content": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Syria called on the United Nations on Sunday to condemn its rebel foes after an apparent attack with unidentified chemicals in the city of Aleppo sent scores of choking victims to hospitals. Medics reported a flood of patients with breathing troubles, inflamed eyes and other symptoms after a shelling attack on Saturday that Syrian and Russian officials blamed on the rebels. The Syrian state news service, SANA, said that more than 100 people had been affected by the attack, although it reported no deaths. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, released slightly lower numbers. A spokesman for Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense said 46 people, including eight children, had been exposed to chemicals. It was not immediately clear who had launched the attack on Saturday or what substance was used. Syria\u2019s dwindling rebel movement is a patchwork of factions with no central command. A few rebel groups denied the government\u2019s accusations. \u201cWe cannot know the kinds of gases, but we suspected chlorine and treated patients on this basis because of the symptoms,\u201d Zaher Batal, the head of the Aleppo Doctors Syndicate, told Reuters. None of Syria\u2019s rebel groups are known to possess powerful nerve agents like sarin, but they could have dosed conventional weapons with substances like chlorine to give their explosions a chemical punch. Chemical weapons have been used throughout the seven-year war in Syria, with the government of President Bashar al-Assad launching the most deadly attacks on rebel enclaves with chemicals like sarin and chlorine. Insurgents are believed to have used chemicals as weapons in smaller attacks on government-held areas. The Syrian Foreign Ministry urged the United Nations Security Council on Sunday to condemn what it called \u201cterrorist crimes\u201d and to take \u201cdeterrent, punitive measures against the nations and regimes that support and fund terrorism.\u201d Russia, which has sent troops and military advisers to support  Mr. Assad, also blamed rebels for the attack. The spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, Gen. Igor Konashenkov, told journalists in Moscow on Sunday that the military\u2019s preliminary assessment was that rebels in neighboring Idlib Province had fired shells filled with chlorine. General Konashenkov said the Russian military had sent chemists to the site of the attack in Aleppo to investigate an artillery strike that released a \u201cpoisonous substance.\u201d The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said warplanes struck rebel territory in northwestern Syria on Sunday, the first time since Russia and Turkey agreed to create a buffer zone in September. The group said the airstrikes hit the suburbs west of Aleppo city, near Idlib, Reuters said.", "date": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-weapons-un.html"},
{"title": "Students Who Made Apparent Nazi Salute in Photo Won\u2019t Be Punished", "description": "The superintendent said the school district was \u201cnot in a position\u201d to discipline the students because of their First Amendment rights.", "author": "By Christina Caron", "content": "The Wisconsin students who appeared to make a Nazi salute in a widely criticized photo will not be punished, the school\u2019s superintendent said this week in a letter to parents. The superintendent, Lori Mueller of the Baraboo School District, said in the letter that the district was \u201cnot in a position to punish the students for their actions\u201d because of their First Amendment rights. \u201cAs previously stated, we cannot know the intentions in the hearts of those who were involved,\u201d Ms. Mueller wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Baraboo News Republic. The district investigated the episode for about 10 days with help from the police. \u201cDespite our efforts, we are still unclear about some key details,\u201d the superintendent wrote on Wednesday. The photograph was taken by a parent in May before the Baraboo High School junior prom, and was not commissioned by the school, the letter said. The boys in the photograph, who were standing outside the Sauk County Courthouse in downtown Baraboo, were current and former students at the high school. In the photo, many of the students stand with one arm raised, palms down and elbows locked straight, in a gesture that looks identical to a Nazi salute. One student in the front row is making the O.K. sign with his right forefinger and thumb, a hand gesture that has been adopted by white nationalists and is often used to troll liberals. The image drew outrage after it was posted on Twitter on Nov. 11 by an anonymous Twitter account. The post said, \u201cWe even got the black kid to throw it up.\u201d (The photograph appears to show one black student, who is partly obscured.) \u201cWe have worked very, very hard over the last six years to make Baraboo very inviting and very inclusive,\u201d Mayor Mike Palm said the week the photo was shared on social media. \u201cObviously, some of that has failed, based on this picture, so we have a lot of work to do.\u201d The parent who took the photo, Peter Gust, posted the image on his website, Wheel Memories, where it was visible until Nov. 12, when it was deleted. It can still be seen via the Wayback Machine, an internet archive. A statement on Mr. Gust\u2019s website said the page with the prom photos had been modified because of \u201cmalevolent behavior on the part of some in society.\u201d \u201cTo anyone that was hurt I sincerely apologize,\u201d the statement said. Not all of the students in the photograph were gesturing. Jordan Blue, a student wearing a red bow tie, could be seen standing in the upper right corner with his hands at his sides. In a statement to Jules Suzdaltsev, a journalist, Mr. Blue said that the photographer had instructed the boys \u201cto make the sign\u201d and that Mr. Blue did not have time to leave because the picture \u201cwas taken within five seconds.\u201d He did not raise his arm because \u201cI knew what my morals were and it was not to salute something I didn\u2019t firmly believe in,\u201d he said. Brock Turkington, who also appeared in the photograph, told the television station WISC that it was not supposed to be a hateful gesture. \u201cAs we were about to take that photo, the photographer instructed the boys to give a \u2018high-sign,\u2019\u201d Mr. Turkington said in a statement to the station. \u201cThe photographer instructed us to extend our arms out, no one knew what a \u2018high-sign\u2019 was. I asked another student next to me \u2018What are we doing?\u2019 He responded, \u2018Stick your arm out.\u2019\u201d \u201cLooking at the picture now, I understand why people believe it is related to anti-Semitism,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAs an outsider, I would have the same impression. That was never the intent at that time.\u201d Mr. Gust, the parent who took the photograph, also insisted it was not meant to be a Nazi salute. \u201cI\u2019d said to them, \u2018O.K., boys, you\u2019re going to say goodbye to your parents, so wave,\u2019\u201d he told WISC, adding that interpreting it as a hateful gesture was \u201cdead wrong.\u201d Baraboo is a town of 12,000 people about 40 miles northwest of Madison. The population is 94 percent white, according to the 2010 census. When the photo began circulating online, the Baraboo School District apologized, saying the image \u201chas been rightly described as hateful, frightening and disappointing\u201d and pledging to host community programs to address the actions of the students, which \u201cdeeply hurt people around the world.\u201d On Monday, more than 200 people attended the first of those forums, the superintendent\u2019s letter said. Another will be held on Thursday. Ms. Mueller wrote that the image had been posted on social media \u201cto create harm.\u201d \u201cOur focus is shifting to work with the students involved on restorative practices to repair broken relationships with peers, families and the community,\u201d she said.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/us/baraboo-wisconsin-nazi-salute-photo.html"},
{"title": "The World Needs to Quit Coal. Why Is It So Hard?", "description": "Coal, the most polluting of energy sources, shows no sign of disappearing three years after the Paris agreement, when world leaders promised decisive action against global warming. ", "author": "By Somini Sengupta", "content": "HANOI, Vietnam \u2014 Coal, the fuel that powered the industrial age, has led the planet to the brink of catastrophic climate change. Scientists have repeatedly warned of its looming dangers, most recently on Friday, when a major scientific report issued by 13 United States government agencies warned that the damage from climate change could knock as much as 10 percent off the size of the American economy by century\u2019s end if significant steps aren\u2019t taken to rein in warming.  An October report from the United Nations\u2019 scientific panel on global warming found that avoiding the worst devastation would require a radical transformation of the world economy in just a few years.  Central to that transformation: Getting out of coal, and fast. And yet, three years after the Paris agreement, when world leaders promised action, coal shows no sign of disappearing. While coal use looks certain to eventually wane worldwide, according to the latest assessment by the International Energy Agency, it is not on track to happen anywhere fast enough to avert the worst effects of climate change. Last year, in fact, global production and consumption increased after two years of decline.  Cheap, plentiful and the most polluting of fossil fuels, coal remains the single largest source of energy to generate electricity worldwide. This, even as renewables like solar and wind power are rapidly becoming more affordable. Soon, coal could make no financial sense for its backers.  So, why is coal so hard to quit? Because coal is a powerful incumbent. It\u2019s there by the millions of tons under the ground. Powerful companies, backed by powerful governments, often in the form of subsidies, are in a rush to grow their markets before it is too late. Banks still profit from it. Big national electricity grids were designed for it. Coal plants can be a surefire way for politicians to deliver cheap electricity \u2014 and retain their own power. In some countries, it has been a glistening source of graft. And even while renewables are spreading fast, they still have limits: Wind and solar power flow when the breeze blows and the sun shines, and that requires traditional electricity grids to be retooled. \u201cThe main reason why coal sticks around is, we built it already,\u201d said Rohit Chandra, who earned a doctoral degree in energy policy at Harvard, specializing in coal in India.  The battle over the future of coal is being waged in Asia.  Home to half the world\u2019s population, Asia accounts for three-fourths of global coal consumption today. More important, it accounts for more than three-fourths of coal plants that are either under construction or in the planning stages \u2014 a whopping 1,200 of them, according to Urgewald, a German advocacy group that tracks coal development. Heffa Sch\u00fccking, who heads Urgewald, called those plants \u201can assault on the Paris goals.\u201d  Indonesia is digging more coal. Vietnam is clearing ground for new coal-fired power plants. Japan, reeling from 2011 nuclear plant disaster, has resurrected coal.  The world\u2019s juggernaut, though, is China. The country consumes half the world\u2019s coal. More than 4.3 million Chinese are employed in the country\u2019s coal mines. China has added 40 percent of the world\u2019s coal capacity since 2002, a huge increase for just 16 years. \u201cI had to do the calculation three times,\u201d said Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Alvarez, a senior energy analyst at the International Energy Agency. \u201cI thought it was wrong. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d  Spurred by public outcry over air pollution, China is now also the world leader in solar and wind power installation, and its central government has tried to slow down coal plant construction. But an analysis by Coal Swarm, a U.S.-based team of researchers that advocates for coal alternatives, concluded that new plants continue to be built, and other proposed projects have simply been delayed rather than stopped. Chinese coal consumption grew in 2017, though at a far slower pace than before, and is on track to grow again in 2018, after declining in previous years.  China\u2019s coal industry is now scrambling to find new markets, from Kenya to Pakistan. Chinese companies are building coal plants in 17 countries, according to Urgewald. Its regional rival, Japan, is in the game too: nearly 60 percent of planned coal projects developed by Japanese companies are outside the country, mostly financed by Japanese banks. That contest is particularly stark in Southeast Asia, one of the world\u2019s last frontiers of coal expansion. Nguy Thi Khanh has seen the contest close-up in Vietnam. Born in 1976, a year after the end of the war, she remembers doing homework by the light of a kerosene lamp. In her northern village, the electricity failed several hours a day. When it rained, there was no power at all. When it came, it came from a coal plant not far away. When her mother hung laundry to dry, ash settled on the clothes. Today, pretty much every household in Vietnam, population 95 million, has electricity. Hanoi, the capital, where Ms. Nguy now lives, is in a frenzy of new construction, with soaring demand for cement and steel \u2014 both energy guzzlers. The economy is galloping. And, up and down the coast, 1,600 kilometers in length, foreign companies, mainly from Japan and China, are building coal plants. One such project is in Nghi Son, a onetime fishing village south of Hanoi and now home to a sprawling industrial zone. The first power plant opened here in 2013. Japan\u2019s overseas aid organization, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, paid for it. The Japanese trading house Marubeni developed it.  A second coal-fired power plant, far bigger, is under construction next door. Marubeni is building that too, along with a Korean company. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation, an export credit agency meant to lower financial risk for private lenders, is helping to fund it. In the shadow of the smokestack, Nguyen Thi Thu Thien was drying shrimp on the side of the road and complaining bitterly. She had moved out of her house after the power plant built an ash pond right in front. \u201cThe coal dust has blackened my house,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the trees are dying. We can\u2019t live there.\u201d She and the others drying shrimp on the road were doubly angry that the new plant would need a new port, and that would displace their husbands, who tie up their fishing boats there. Trucks rumbled by, throwing up dust, as the women emptied their baskets of shrimp. They kept every bit of themselves covered: wide brimmed hats, face masks, gloves.  Coal accounts for 36 percent of the country\u2019s power generation capacity now; it is projected to grow to 42 percent by 2030, according to the government. To feed those plants, Vietnam will need to import 90 million tons of coal by 2030. But coal projects are also sparking community opposition rare in a country that squelches dissent. Villagers blocked a highway in 2015 to protest a Chinese project in the southeast. The provincial authorities quashed another proposed plant in the Mekong Delta.  Most plants in Vietnam use old, polluting technologies that many investors, including Marubeni, have recently promised not to back in future projects. A company spokesman said by email that it would continue with the Nghi Son project \u201cto contribute to stable power supply and to economic growth.\u201d Vietnam says it is on track to meet its emissions reductions targets under the Paris accord. So, too, China and India, with far bigger carbon footprints. But those targets were set by the countries themselves, and they will not be enough to keep global temperatures from rising to calamitous levels. The United States has said it will exit the Paris climate pact. Those sobering facts loom over the next round of international climate negotiations, starting Dec. 3 in the heart of Poland\u2019s coal country. The American delegation plans to promote coal at the event, just as it did at last year\u2019s talks in Bonn, Germany. In the public imagination, the coal miner has long been a symbol of industrial virility, a throwback to an era when hard labor \u2014 particularly men\u2019s labor, rather than robots \u2014 fueled economic growth.  That idea has been central to politics. German coal miners have lifted the fortunes of that country\u2019s far-right party. Poland\u2019s right-wing government has promised to open new coal mines. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, rose to power as a champion of coal.  President Trump has promised, unsuccessfully so far, to revive coal mining jobs and instructed his Environmental Protection Agency to roll back rules to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants.  That message might be welcome in American coal country, but the industry\u2019s future in the United States is not promising. There are cheaper fuels, including natural gas; gas now accounts for around 31 percent of total power generation in the United States, the same share as coal. China has imposed tariffs on coal imports from the United States, in the tit-for-tat trade dispute. More than 200 coal plants have closed since 2010, and coal consumption has continued to decline, contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims. Coal mining jobs have plummeted over the last decade, despite a modest increase of about 4 percent in the first 18 months of the Trump presidency. The economics, and the political calculus, are very different in the world\u2019s biggest democracy: India, population 1.3 billion.  Ajay Mishra, the career civil servant in charge of energy in the central Indian state of Telangana, knows firsthand. Five years ago, he said, daily power cuts cursed his state. Ceiling fans cut out on stifling summer afternoons. Factories ran on diesel-guzzling generators. The people of Telangana were furious. State officials had to do something to fix the electricity problem. They harnessed the sun, briefly making Telangana a leading solar power producer in India. They also turned to what government officials have relied on for over a century: the vast vein of coal that sat underground, stretching across the hills and forests of central India.  Telangana now has round-the-clock electricity. Its farmers get it free to pump water. It sweetens the re-election bid of Telangana\u2019s top elected official, K. Chandrashekar Rao, in state polls later this year.  \u201cWe have coal,\u201d Mr. Mishra said. \u201cWe are producing more every year. For the next 100 years we have it.\u201d  On a warm Tuesday in October, about a four-hour drive from Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, an army of men in indigo shorts went underground to dig it out.  A simple pulley drew them in, a bit like a ski lift, except here, it took them deeper and deeper down a shaft. The creak of the pulley was all you could hear, and water, drip-dripping inside the earth. Here and there, off to the side, stood miners, their forms barely visible in the darkness, except for the belted flashlights that snaked across their bodies. At about 900 feet below the surface, where the air was black and cool and the coal under our feet was squishy, a burst of explosives broke down a wall of coal. Small, sooty chunks were piled into tubs and wheeled out, then loaded onto coal trucks that hurtled down the country roads, sprinkling a layer of ash everywhere. So deeply is India invested in coal, this, like other mines, is state owned. So are most power plants. Coal subsidizes the country\u2019s vast rail network.  That person at the top of that system, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has sought to cast himself as a champion of clean energy.  But Mr. Modi has been inaugurating new coal mines, too. His government has made it faster for industry, including mining, to get environmental clearances, rankling environmentalists. India\u2019s state-owned companies are building new coal-fired plants across the country, almost all of them financed by public sector banks. In an interview in the capital, New Delhi, India\u2019s energy secretary, Ajay Bhalla, said some 50 gigawatts of additional coal capacity were under construction. That\u2019s a fraction of what was under development even a decade ago, when India\u2019s energy demand was projected to soar. Many of those plants are meant to replace older, more polluting ones. But coal would not sunset anytime soon, he predicted, not until there\u2019s a cheap and efficient way to store energy from solar and wind energy. Analysts say India must retool its electricity grid for the post-coal era. Battery technology is fast advancing. Microgrids can replace traditional electricity systems. Many existing coal plants are now running below capacity, several are idle, and new energy efficiency standards could slow down demand to the point where there may be a glut of costly coal-fired plants. Left holding this bundle of stranded assets: The public sector banks that financed them.  For now, though, coal accounts for 58 percent of India\u2019s energy mix.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m using the coal very willingly,\u201d Mr. Bhalla said. \u201cBut I have to.\u201d", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/climate/coal-global-warming.html"},

In the men\u2019s downhill at Lake Louise, Max Franz won.", "author": "By The Associated Press", "content": "Three months ago, Federica Brignone was on crutches after hurting her left knee in a training crash. It didn\u2019t take her long to get back up to speed. Brignone, of Italy, won a giant slalom for her ninth career World Cup victory Saturday in Killington, Vt., with Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States taking fourth. On a windy afternoon, Brignone mastered the course in 1 minute, 51.33 seconds to beat the first-run leader, Ragnhild Mowinckel of Norway, by 0.49 seconds. Stephanie Brunner of Austria took third for her first career World Cup podium finish. Brignone made a slight mistake on the course and thought she no longer had a chance to win. Seeing her name at the top after crossing the finish line caught her by surprise. \u201cUnexpected for sure,\u201d Brignone said. \u201cBecause I had that big mistake. It\u2019s always like, \u2018Yes, I did it!\u2019 \u201d It was another splendid performance for Brignone, who took second at last month\u2019s season-opening giant slalom in S\u00f6lden, Austria. In August, she hurt one of the ligaments in her knee but avoided serious damage. She returned to the slopes after missing a few weeks, including some work at the United State ski team\u2019s speed center in Copper Mountain, Colo. After the victory, Brignone spent time signing as many autographs as she could for the youngsters in the crowd. \u201cI remember when I was a kid and going around to some races and wanted to get the autograph from the\u201d winner,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I tried to stop to each little guy or little girl that wanted my autograph and I hope I did it for everyone.\u201d Shiffrin, the reigning Olympic giant slalom champion, fell during a morning training session but was able to race. She was sixth after the opening run. \u201cI was happy with some of my skiing but I wasn\u2019t happy with the intensity,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cWatching some of the other girls come down, they\u2019re skiing like they want it. \u201cI want it, too, but I was enjoying it too much.\u201d Shiffrin, two-time overall World Cup champion, was more aggressive on her final run. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite enough,\u201d she said. Of her first World Cup podium, Brunner described her emotions as \u201ccrazy.\u201d She said competing before so many fans made her feel as if she were racing in Austria. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Brunner said.

AUSTRIAN WINS MEN\u2019S DOWNHILL Being the first one to take the course, Max Franz of Austria had no idea if his run was particularly fast or worthy of the podium. He watched and watched as racers tried to match his time. No one did. Leading off, Franz turned in a blistering time to win the season-opening World Cup downhill in Lake Louise, Alberta. Franz finished in 1:46.18 to hold off Christof Innerhofer of Italy by 0.28 seconds. Dominik Paris of Italy was third, 0.54 seconds back. In recent weeks, Franz has been dealing with a knee issue. Coming into Lake Louise, he was unsure how it would hold up. \u201cI had a really good run,\u201d Franz said. \u201cBut I made a little bit of a mistake. It looks like it was a good line.\u201d Franz said the weather slightly changed, with the wind picking up near the top of the course. \u201cI had the luck on my side today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great day.\u201d This was the second career World Cup win for Franz, 29. He also won a downhill race in Italy nearly two years ago. Innerhofer knew he had the speed to be on the podium after turning in the top time during Wednesday\u2019s training session. Racing second, he was on pace to top Franz before losing time near the bottom. \u201cI knew my run was not bad and hoped for top 10,\u201d Innerhofer said. \u201cEveryone says I\u2019m the world champion in the training runs. Now I say it\u2019s time to go up in the race, too.\u201d Steven Nyman of the United States finished 11th, a spot ahead of his teammate Bryce Bennett.

{"title": "Betty Bumpers, Campaigner for Childhood Vaccinations, Dies at 93", "description": "Using her influence as an Arkansas first lady and senator\u2019s wife, she earned national recognition for her efforts to promote immunizations.", "author": "By Steve Barnes", "content": "Betty Bumpers, whose advocacy of childhood immunization won her national recognition while serving as first lady of Arkansas and after accompanying her husband, Dale L. Bumpers, to Washington when he won a Senate seat, died on Friday in Little Rock, Ark. She was 93. Her son Brent said the cause was complications of dementia. She had been in failing health and had recently fractured a hip, he said. A native of tiny Grand Prairie, Ark., Mrs. Bumpers had been content with her life as an elementary school teacher and homemaker in nearby Charleston, where her husband was born, when he rocketed to the Arkansas governorship in 1970, running as a liberal Democrat and a relative unknown. Once installed in the governor\u2019s mansion, Mrs. Bumpers was startled to discover that tens of thousands of Arkansas children had not been inoculated against common but potentially fatal diseases like measles, mumps and diphtheria. With the governor\u2019s support, she rallied private and public sectors to back an immunization campaign called Every Child by \u201974. The vaccination rate in Arkansas soared, and the incidence of preventable infections quickly plummeted. After her husband\u2019s election to the Senate in 1974, Mrs. Bumpers expanded her mission after learning that fewer than one in five states mandated immunization as a condition for enrollment in public schools. (Children in schools are common transmitters of communicable illnesses.) Beginning in 1977, Mrs. Bumpers and the first lady, Rosalynn Carter, led a state-by-state campaign promoting pre-school immunizations. The effort prompted 33 states to enact such programs, in which proof of vaccinations was mandated before children could enroll in kindergarten or other first-year classes in public schools. They joined the 17 other states that already had such programs. By the fall of 1980, the Centers for Disease Control reported that disease among public school children was \u201cat or near record low levels.\u201d In 1991, a measles outbreak that infected 55,000 people and led to the deaths of about 120, moved Mrs. Bumpers and Mrs. Carter to expand their efforts by starting a nonprofit campaign, Every Child by Two. The organization, based in Washington, encourages immunizations of children for mumps, measles, rubella and other illnesses by the age of 2. Mrs. Bumpers\u2019 volunteerism earned her numerous honors from humanitarian organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics. The Vaccine Research Center of the National Institutes of Health is named for her and Mr. Bumpers. In the 1980s, when relations between Washington and Moscow were strained, Mrs. Bumpers\u2019 concerns expanded to encompass the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the risks of nuclear war. She established Peace Links, a global network of like-minded women who argued for less confrontational rhetoric and more vigorous diplomatic initiatives to reduce the odds of a nuclear confrontation. Mr. Bumpers, undefeated after four Senate terms, retired in January 1999 but returned to the chamber that month to deliver the closing argument against the impeachment of his fellow Arkansan, President Bill Clinton, who was acquitted. Mr. Bumpers died at 90 in 2016. Betty Lou Flanagan was born on Jan. 11, 1925. Her mother, Ola, was a teacher, and her father, Herman, was a farmer and a cattle merchant. Betty attended Iowa State University and the University of Arkansas without earning a degree from either and earned a certificate from the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. She became a teacher, and she and Mr. Bumpers were married in 1949. (Arkansas did not require teachers then to have a college degree.) In addition to her son Brent, Mrs. Bumpers is survived by another son, William, and a daughter, Margaret Brooke Bumpers, as well as seven grandchildren.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/obituaries/betty-bumpers-dead-vaccinations.html"},

His death drew criticism from his family and protesters on Saturday.", "author": "By Mihir Zaveri", "content": "An Alabama police officer fatally shot a 21-year-old black man on Thursday night who the police said shot at least one person at a mall near Birmingham, turning a Thanksgiving holiday shopping scene into chaos. But on Friday the police said evidence suggests that the man actually was not the gunman and that the true gunman remained at large. The Hoover Police Department said on Twitter that the man who was killed, Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., \u201cmay have been involved in some aspect\u201d of an altercation at the mall, the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, Ala., that preceded the shooting. But, they said, he \u201clikely did not fire the rounds\u201d that struck an 18-year-old man as they had originally indicated. Another victim, a 12-year-old girl, was an \u201cinnocent bystander,\u201d the police said. Both were hospitalized but their conditions on Saturday were unavailable. \u201cWe regret that our initial media release was not totally accurate, but new evidence indicates that it was not,\u201d the police said, adding that the conclusion was based on interviews with witnesses and \u201ccritical evidentiary items.\u201d In their initial statement on Friday, the police said uniformed officers who were providing security at the mall \u201cencountered a suspect brandishing a pistol and shot him.\u201d It was not clear whether the officers believed Mr. Bradford fired or intended to fire before he was killed. Mr. Bradford\u2019s mother, April Pipkins, said in an interview on Saturday that Mr. Bradford was living with her near Birmingham where he had been raised. Mr. Bradford, who was better known as E.J., would not have been involved in the shooting, and might have been trying to protect other people in the mall, she said. \u201cThat was not his character at all,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loved life, and he loved people.\u201d He was licensed to carry a firearm, she said. Alabama generally does not prohibit people from carrying firearms in public, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Anthony Thomas, Mr. Bradford\u2019s uncle, said he wanted the police to release all the videos from the mall that day. \u201cHe was an honorable young man who was assassinated,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. Ms. Pipkins is being represented by Benjamin L. Crump, a Tallahassee, Fla., lawyer, who has in the past represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Tamir Rice. Mr. Crump said the Hoover police had tarnished Mr. Bradford\u2019s character by \u201cjumping to conclusions\u201d that he was a criminal because he was a black man with a gun. \u201cHe was trying to be somebody who helped save people, yet he was killed,\u201d Mr. Crump said. Mr. Bradford received a general discharge from the United States Army in August. An Army spokesman said Mr. Bradford had not completed his training but would not elaborate. Capt. Gregg Rector, a spokesman for the Hoover Police Department, said on Saturday that it would be inappropriate to answer questions about the circumstances around Mr. Bradford\u2019s death because the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency was leading the investigation. The Hoover Police Department is, however, conducting an internal investigation into Mr. Bradford\u2019s killing by the officer. That officer, who has not been identified, has been put on administrative leave until the investigation is complete. Captain Rector did not answer other questions about the officer on Saturday. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency declined to comment on Saturday and said that it would issue a statement on Sunday. On Saturday, a group of protesters gathered at the mall, saying the police shot the wrong person. One carried a sign that said \u201cEmantic\u2019s Life Matters.\u201d Others carried a large blue banner reading \u201cNo police gun violence.\u201d The episode on Thursday sent crowds of people running through the Riverchase Galleria, about 10 miles south of Birmingham, according to videos posted on Twitter. One shopper told the television station WBRC that she was buying jewelry at a kiosk when she heard three bangs and people started screaming and running for the exits as officers ran toward the gunfire. The police said they now believe that more than two people were involved in the altercation that preceded the shooting and that at least one gunman remains at large. The police did not release a description of the person they were seeking. The mall, whose website boasts that it is \u201cthe largest enclosed shopping center in Alabama,\u201d had advertised special hours for the night of Thanksgiving: 6 p.m. to midnight.

{"title": "U.K. and E.U. Leaders Clinch Brexit Divorce Terms", "description": "The settlement reached at a summit meeting on Sunday must pass testing parliamentary votes, and leaves deep uncertainties about Britain\u2019s future.", "author": "By Stephen Castle and Steven Erlanger", "content": "BRUSSELS \u2014 More than four decades after Britain tied itself to its Continental neighbors, Prime Minister Theresa May obtained the approval of the other 27 European Union members on a formal divorce pact from the bloc, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said on Sunday. It is a consequential step intended to take the country on a new, if unclear, path. The journey has been long and tortuous for both sides, and the drama is hardly over. Mrs. May must still get approval for the deal \u2014 a dense, legally binding divorce settlement and a set of political promises for Britain\u2019s future relationship with the bloc \u2014 from an outspokenly unhappy British Parliament. Since Britons voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, Mrs. May has struggled to define how closely they should remain tied to Continental Europe, ultimately choosing a kind of middle way that has left many dissatisfied. With her own Conservative Party deeply divided and the opposition Labour Party promising to vote the deal down, Mrs. May faces what most consider to be an almost impossible task. But she is dogged, and, with Britain scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, she appears to be relying on giving legislators a stark choice: her deal or a chaotic exit without any deal. If she fails, what happens next would be anyone\u2019s guess. Mrs. May could face a leadership challenge or be left to put her deal to a second vote in the British Parliament. There could be a push for a softer Brexit, new elections or a second referendum. Or Britain could lurch toward a no-deal Brexit, an outcome no one wants on either side of the Channel. In an open letter to the nation, Mrs. May said she would campaign \u201cheart and soul\u201d to get the deal approved. \u201cIt will be a deal that is in our national interest \u2014 one that works for our whole country and all of our people, whether you voted Leave or Remain,\u201d she said. Even as the 27 other leaders of the European Union put their imprimatur on the agreement, they were eager to do nothing to make Mrs. May\u2019s task any harder. They, like much of the British public, are heartily sick of Brexit, and Europe has other challenges to deal with, including migration and populism, Russian aggression and the Italian budget threat to the euro. Antonio Tajani, the president of the European Parliament, bemoaned that Brexit was happening at all. \u201cToday is not a good day,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBut after long consideration, we believe the agreement is a good one.\u201d Several European leaders warned on Sunday that negotiations could not be reopened should the British Parliament reject the deal. \u201cThis is the deal,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm. \u201cIt\u2019s the best deal possible. The European Union will not change its fundamental position.\u201d But Mr. Juncker, too, said to the news media, \u201cIt\u2019s not a moment for jubilation nor celebration; it\u2019s a sad and tragic moment.\u201d He said he believed that Mrs. May would succeed in getting the British Parliament to approve the deal, but would not speculate on what might happen if she could not. Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, whose country is one of Britain\u2019s closest trading partners, also expressed confidence that Mrs. May would succeed in persuading Parliament to pass the deal. But asked if the bloc might make more concessions, he warned: \u201cThis is the maximum we can all do.\u201d Britain\u2019s break with Europe was never going to be easy. Even if Britain ratifies the deal, the end of March will see the beginning of many months, possibly years, of negotiations on its future relationship \u2014 from trade and travel to security and intelligence. European officials have been eager to try to help Mrs. May get the deal ratified by embracing language in the political declaration about Britain\u2019s long-term ties with the bloc, which will be closer and of a different kind than any other third country. Britain\u2019s allies, including the Netherlands, pressed hard for a reference in the declaration to \u201can ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation, law enforcement and criminal justice, foreign policy, security and defense and wider areas of cooperation.\u201d They hoped to describe a close relationship that went far beyond a trade deal of the kind the bloc has negotiated with Canada and Japan. But to British critics, the proposals represent the worst of all worlds, a Britain that is neither in, nor fully out, of the European Union. If negotiations fail to produce a good outcome, they fear that Britain could be trapped in Europe\u2019s orbit, obliged to obey rules for years to come without the ability to shape them or cut its own trade deals around the globe. \u201cThe summit itself could be something of an anticlimax,\u201d said Anthony Teasdale, author of \u201cThe Penguin Companion to European Union.\u201d \u201cBut the act of signing on the dotted line to leave the European Union is a defining moment in British history, there is no doubt about that.\u201d \u201cMany of the younger generation take membership completely for granted,\u201d Mr. Teasdale added. \u201cHaving been in the E.U. all their lives, they have difficulty conceptually working out what being outside might look like.\u201d Britain joined the European Union\u2019s forerunner in 1973 and embarked, often grudgingly, on a process of integration that accelerated from the mid-1980s. Economic rules are now so intertwined that the former director-general of the World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, has likened Brexit to removing an egg from an omelet. But Britain was always hesitant \u2014 or outright resistant \u2014 to pooling sovereignty with a group of Continental countries that joined together after World War II, from which the British emerged victorious. \u201cBrexit is probably a bigger break for Britain than for the European Union, as the perception from the Continent has always been that Britain was somewhat aloof and detached and closer to the U.S. than Europe,\u201d said Holger Nehring, professor of contemporary European history at the University of Stirling. Months of difficult negotiations produced the legally binding withdrawal agreement and a vaguer set of pledges concerning a future relationship with the bloc, both of which were officially adopted in Brussels on Sunday. A few side issues had remained to be resolved, including Gibraltar, which the weak Spanish government is insisting must be treated only as a bilateral issue with Britain. The sovereignty of Gibraltar, a British overseas territory on Spain\u2019s coast that Spain claims as its own, has always been a point of contention. But after British assurances, Spain ultimately did not hold up the deal. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said on Saturday at a news conference in Madrid that until recently, the fate of Gibraltar had not featured in the negotiations, but now Brussels and London \u201chave accepted the demands set by Spain.\u201d Under the plan, Britain would leave the European Union in March but adhere to the bloc\u2019s rules and regulations at least until December 2020, while negotiators try to sort out the longer-term future. That the divorce agreement would be accepted by Mrs. May and the European Union has been little doubted since the British cabinet approved it this month. In addition to approval by the British Parliament, it will also need ratification by the European Parliament. For the moment, though, the blessing of European leaders on Sunday finally put on the table a formal divorce deal that would chart for Britain a gradual and orderly departure. That 585-page treaty deals with Britain\u2019s outstanding payments to the bloc of around $50 billion, the rights of European Union citizens in Britain and vice versa, and how to prevent physical checks on goods at the frontier between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union. Most of the debate and upset in Britain focuses on the Irish border and a \u201cbackstop\u201d plan to tide the two sides over until technology \u2014 or another form of trading arrangement \u2014 can dispense with the need for strict physical controls. The backstop would apply after the 20-month transition period (which could be extended by a maximum of two years) and only if there were no other solution to the Irish border issue. In that case, the whole of the United Kingdom would remain in a European customs union, while Northern Ireland would have to abide by more of the bloc\u2019s economic regulations. In theory, at least, the pact will allow the British government time to dismantle a set of laws and structures that have become pillars of British economic, political and diplomatic life, while negotiating with Brussels on a new relationship. No one in Brussels knows any better than people in Britain about what is coming next, but there is considerable hope that somehow Mrs. May will pull it off.", "date": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/europe/brexit-uk-eu-agreement.html"},
{"title": "Across South, Democrats Who Speak Boldly Risk Alienating Rural White Voters", "description": "Mike Espy, the Democratic nominee in the Mississippi Senate election Tuesday, has had to choose between satisfying African-Americans and white liberals or driving away conservative-leaning voters.", "author": "By Jonathan Martin", "content": "JACKSON, Miss. \u2014 When Mike Espy, the Democrat challenging Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, faced his opponent at a debate ahead of this Tuesday\u2019s runoff election, he had to make a choice: confront Ms. Hyde-Smith over her comments about attending \u201ca public hanging,\u201d which evoked the state\u2019s racist history, or take a milder approach to avoid alienating the conservative-leaning white voters who will most likely decide the election. He chose the latter. \u201cThe world knows what she said, the world knows that those comments were harmful and hurtful,\u201d Mr. Espy said afterward, sounding not entirely convinced. In a state where politics has long been cleaved by race, Mr. Espy was reckoning with a conundrum that Democrats face across the South \u2014 from Mississippi and Alabama, which have been hostile to the party for years, to states like Florida and Georgia that are more hospitable in cities but still challenging in many predominantly white areas. Even as they made gains in the 2018 elections in the suburbs that were once Republican pillars, Democrats are seeing their already weak standing in rural America erode even further. Now, as Democrats mount a last-minute and decidedly against-the-odds campaign to snatch a Senate seat in this most unlikely of states, they are facing the same problem that undermined some of their most-heralded candidates earlier this month. The campaigns of Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Andrew Gillum in Florida and Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas may have electrified black and progressive white voters \u2014 just as Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments may energize Mississippians to support Mr. Espy \u2014 but they had an equal and opposite effect as well: in rural county after rural county, this trio of next-generation Democrats performed worse than President Barack Obama did in 2012. As Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba put it, Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments are \u201cgoing to excite two different demographics: the base of supporters that follow this Trump ideology of saying what you want, and those individuals who share a close connection to that dehumanizing history.\u201d More ominous for Democrats was that the deep losses this year among rural and some exurban whites were not just confined to Southern states where they nominated unabashed progressives with hopes of transforming the midterm electorate. They lost four Senate seats, as well as governor\u2019s races in states like Iowa and Ohio, with more conventional candidates whose strength in cities and upper-income suburbs was not enough to overcome their deficits in less densely populated areas. As Democrats look toward the 2020 presidential election, this demographic chasm is alarming party strategists who fear that it could cement the G.O.P\u2019s grip on the Senate and make it difficult to defeat President Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s a baseline percent of the white vote you have to get to win and you can\u2019t get to it just through young and progressive excitement,\u201d said Steve Schale, a Florida-based Democratic strategist who worked on Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns there and last week wrote a memo urging his party to grapple with why they got close but lost some key races this year. \u201cThe path from 48 to 50 is like climbing Mount Everest without oxygen.\u201d While Mr. Obama is remembered for galvanizing an ascendant bloc of voters of color, millennials and unmarried women, Mr. Schale said, \u201cthe piece of the Obama coalition that people forget is that he did not sustain these kinds of losses in rural and exurban areas.\u201d Mr. Obama invested resources and manpower in some of these communities, but also had the benefit of campaigning when the electorate was marginally less polarized. Yet as Democrats consider how to win again in Florida, and how aggressively to contest Georgia in 2020, it remains unclear if they can reverse their downward trajectory in the most heavily white parts of each state. Some African-Americans believe that it is futile in the Trump era to try to win over conservative-leaning white Republicans, especially in the South, because such voters form a \u201cresistance\u201d of their own against the country\u2019s cultural and demographic changes. These voters aren\u2019t only energized by campaigns by federal and state offices, but also recent fights over bathrooms and gender in North Carolina, gay rights in Georgia and displays of the Ten Commandments in Alabama, all of which roused powerful forces of conservatism rooted more in cultural traditionalism than racial grievance. Roland Martin, an African-American commentator, said that Democrats should not forsake heavily white communities entirely; but ultimately, he said, the party\u2019s fate in the South would swing on turnout among minority voters. \u201cBecause there are still more white voters, what it means is that people of color are going to have to have higher turnout rates,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cAndrew Gillum cannot win Florida if Miami-Dade turnout is below 60 percent, period.\u201d The turnout gap was stark in Florida, the most pivotal presidential swing state. Only 56 percent of registered voters cast ballots in Miami-Dade County, one of the worst showings in the state. But in Collier County, which includes Naples and where there are few African-Americans, turnout was over 73 percent \u2014 the highest the jurisdiction had ever recorded in a midterm campaign. In Mississippi, which has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1982, the political conditions are even more forbidding. For one thing, the population of white liberals is vanishingly small. Further, Mr. Espy is a moderate by inclination and, his advisers privately concede, does not want to trigger a backlash by being too confrontational with Ms. Hyde-Smith. \u201cIt is absolutely a challenge, but that\u2019s a challenge that he had walking in the door,\u201d Mr. Lumumba said of the difficulty of capitalizing on Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments. \u201cWe were just waiting on the moment the conversation would happen.\u201d But if questions about race would inevitably surface in a Senate race between a black man and a white woman in Mississippi, Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s misstep has also revived another enduring element of Southern politics: the tension between not wanting outsiders to shape their elections and not wanting their politicians to humiliate the state and vindicate old stereotypes. \u201cThey just don\u2019t want to be embarrassed,\u201d said Joe Trippi, one of Mr. Espy\u2019s strategists, who last year harnessed a mix of energy among African-American voters and shame among white voters to steer Doug Jones to victory in the Alabama Senate race over former state Supreme Court Justice Roy S. Moore. The first part of this equation is unmistakably present: just a few hours after Walmart announced last week that it was asking for its contribution back from Ms. Hyde-Smith, word of the retailer\u2019s snub had already made its way to the lunch line at the Big Apple Inn, a soul food carryout and a Jackson institution. Yet while six companies have now asked Ms. Hyde-Smith to refund their donations because of her remarks, she has not been accused of sexual impropriety with minors in the fashion of Mr. Moore. And while they may be neighbors, Mississippi is not Alabama (Alabama has larger population centers and a larger segment of college-educated voters). Unlike the defiant Mr. Moore, Ms. Hyde-Smith and her advisers have been torn over how to explain her comments about attending a public hanging. They were divided on how to respond, according to Republicans familiar with the deliberations, but after internal G.O.P. polling indicated that her lead had eroded, it became clear she had to offer some measure of regret. Yet it is an indication of how invested Republicans are in Trumpian politics \u2014 never betray weakness to their base of white voters \u2014 that Ms. Hyde-Smith refused to offer a full-throated apology during the candidates\u2019 recent debate. While she used the forum to apologize to \u201canyone that was offended,\u201d the senator, who was appointed earlier this year to fill the seat vacated by the ailing Thad Cochran, quickly pivoted from contrition to confrontation in a statement that she recited from practice. \u201cThis comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\u201d she complained. Her hybrid response was an indication that Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s advisers are as concerned about turning off conservatives by bowing to liberal outrage as they are about moderate whites staying home out of embarrassment. That this is their assessment was also made clear when Republicans scrambled to deploy Mr. Trump to Mississippi for a pair of election eve rallies on opposite ends of the state. To Mississippians of a certain age and moderate political inclination, the whole spectacle has been cringe-inducing if not entirely surprising. \u201cShe\u2019s a reflection of the politics of our state,\u201d said Curtis Wilkie, a longtime political reporter who has returned home to teach at the University of Mississippi. \u201cJust as we\u2019re trying to rehabilitate our image, people do something to bring us back to the Jim Crow days.\u201d Or as Stuart Stevens, a longtime Republican strategist and Jackson native, put it: \u201cIt\u2019s three steps forward, two steps back.\u201d This year was supposed to mark a moment of progress for Mississippi. The state just opened a new history and civil rights museum under the same roof. Both offer an unvarnished account of Mississippi\u2019s searing racial history, detailing the state\u2019s record number of lynchings, portraying its segregation-era leaders as the white supremacists they were and altogether dispatching with \u201cthe \u2018Lost Cause\u2019 of the failed Confederacy,\u201d as one display terms it. But there\u2019s something peculiar about the museum, as Lauren Stennis noted. Ms. Stennis is an artist and the granddaughter of former Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, a onetime segregationist. She has spent the last few years promoting a redesigned state flag that she devised to replace the current one, which is the last in the country to include the Confederate battle flag. The new museum that seeks to be honest about the state\u2019s past in its exhibits does not reckon with the present on the outside. Instead of flying Mississippi\u2019s divisive flag or keeping it furled \u2014 decisions which would have offended the same constituencies that are pulling the South\u2019s politics further apart \u2014 the state avoided the choice altogether. They just decided not to build a flagpole outside the museum.", "date": "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/us/politics/south-race-mississippi-senate.html"},

The team\u2019s bulldozing potency wrecked opponents across its first 11 games \u2014 even in the Chiefs\u2019 two losses, they have scored 91 points \u2014 and it will torment those charged with thwarting them across their final five, and beyond. A defense that can foil Kansas City has yet to materialize in full. On Monday night, the Rams sure tried, hassling Mahomes and forcing five turnovers, but he still minced them for 478 yards and six touchdowns in a 54-51 loss. New England stifled the Chiefs in the red zone in Week 6, but still gave up 40 points. Kansas City would welcome a rematch \u2014 with either team. Both, really. The Chiefs don\u2019t play this weekend, but before the playoffs \u2014 and, quite possibly, during them \u2014 they will encounter an opponent that appears equipped to slow them, a defense that coaxes interceptions and excels in the red zone and might prevent them from scoring so darn quickly and often. That team lurks in the Chiefs\u2019 division \u2014 the A.F.C. West \u2014 and just happens to be visiting Arrowhead Stadium in mid-December. That is when the Chiefs conclude their season series with the Los Angeles Chargers, three months after the teams opened in California with a 38-28 Kansas City victory. Back then, Mahomes tossed four touchdown passes in a performance that introduced his otherworldly talents. He has blossomed since then, and Kansas City\u2019s offense has evolved, but so have the Chargers (7-3), whose combination of pass-rushers and playmakers in the secondary has helped them seize fifth place in the A.F.C., which will be the top wild-card spot if they hold on. In the opener, the Chargers pressured Mahomes on 43.3 percent of his dropbacks, according to Pro Football Focus. That\u2019s the most pressure he has faced all season \u2014 and it came when Joey Bosa, the Chargers\u2019 star edge rusher, was out with an injury. Bosa returned last week against the Broncos, rejoining Melvin Ingram to form one of the league\u2019s foremost pass-rushing duos. Since losing to the Rams in Week 3, the Chargers have won six of seven games. Over that stretch, they have allowed the fewest points in the league, an average of 16.6, because of their stinginess in the red zone, where opponents have scored touchdowns against the Chargers only 47.1 percent of the time, the fourth-best mark in the N.F.L. The Chargers stopped a late, go-ahead 2-point conversion in a 20-19 victory against Tennessee in Week 7, and then after their bye prevented Seattle from scoring a touchdown on the final play that could have forced overtime. The Chargers have forced four turnovers in red-zone situations, a figure matched only by Miami, while allowing a 68.4 passer rating that ranks second in the league, according to PFF. Defensive coordinator Gus Bradley coached the Seahawks\u2019 Legion of Boom secondary in its embryonic stages. He had an intimidating strong safety, Kam Chancellor, with diverse talents: Chancellor was an enforcer against the run, a dynamo in coverage, an asset in the pass rush. Now with the Chargers, Bradley has a promising equivalent in the rookie Derwin James, the 17th pick of the draft. Like Chancellor, James aligns mostly in the box but has ranged all over the field. He leads all safeties in sacks, with four, and pressures (sacks, hits and hurries), with 15. His 35.7 pressure percentage, according to PFF, is best among the 25 safeties with at least 12 pass-rush snaps this season. As teams more regularly deploy three- and four-receiver sets, defenses counter by playing more defensive backs, amplifying the significance of slot cornerbacks. The best are versatile enough to cover smaller, faster receivers, like Julian Edelman of New England, or athletic tight ends like Travis Kelce of Kansas City, while also providing run support and, at times, aiding a blitz. In Desmond King, the Chargers have a superb nickel corner. He has faced more targets in the slot without allowing a touchdown (38) than any other defensive back, according to PFF, while limiting quarterbacks to a league-low 62.2 passer rating when throwing his way \u2014 partly a product of his three interceptions. On the boundary, the Chargers\u2019 Casey Hayward has yet to pick off a pass \u2014 an oddity for someone who grabbed 11 over his previous two seasons \u2014 but his tight coverage has flummoxed receivers. Among the 102 cornerbacks who have been thrown at 25 or more times, Hayward ranks first with a 27.0 forced incompletion percentage, according to PFF. What could undermine the Chargers\u2019 defense is its diluted front seven, which lost linebacker Denzel Perryman and defensive tackle Corey Liuget to season-ending injuries and has yielded at least 103 rushing yards in each of the last five games. In other words, even if the Chargers manage to suppress Mahomes and the league\u2019s most creative passing offense, they still have to contend with Kareem Hunt, the A.F.C.\u2019s leading rusher. The Chargers will have their own expectations to draw from, plus almost a season\u2019s worth of Chiefs tendencies to study and parse and explore. They hope to do better than last time, better than others who have struggled. Their best might just be good enough.", "date": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/sports/chiefs-chargers.html"},

I manage a team of people. The most competent person on my team is also, unfortunately, the most annoying. Everything he does that isn\u2019t directly related to his  job or to making my job easier absolutely drives me crazy. I have a hard time putting on a fake face about it. I just want to scream.  He\u2019s one of those people that watch you do things and then comments as you\u2019re doing them: \u201cHaving a snack?\u201d as I am having a snack. \u201cHeading out?\u201d as I am putting my coat on at 5 p.m. \u201cOh no, are you sick?\u201d as I grab a tissue. Sometimes he\u2019ll just stare at me until I cannot handle the feeling of his eyes drilling into my skull and am forced to look up to acknowledge him. I feel bad because he\u2019s capable, but I am having a hard time hiding my true feelings. The trick of capitalism is that we simultaneously live for the immediate, destructive moment (These trees, people, minerals, oceans only matter today, let\u2019s burn them, drink them, use them up!) and for the long view (My grandchildren will be world-ruling plutocrats and my name will adorn a fleet of mansions). These two notions are in conflict, impossible to reconcile. This is why the young people today have such wrinkled brows and so many angry tweets. They know that the math of this reconciliation will be calculated in their lifetimes. They know that the last hundred years have been a trash bargain. We sold their safety and health and freedom so that we could all have bigger houses, more billionaires and more ads on Instagram celebrating teas that allegedly trigger human emaciation or erection. For us older-than-millennial people, who are all likely to die before the Final Planetary Showdown, essentially every moment at work is a series of terrible choices between exploitation and vanity. We self-soothe with \u201cThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,\u201d or meat, or Adderall \u2014 while, ironically, our workplaces find ever-more-impressive ways to also monetize our self-soothing. What were we talking about? Oh, right! You should tell this person: \u201cStop policing my behavior, it makes me uncomfortable.\u201d Uncomfortable is a keyword that makes lawyers and H.R. people, well, uncomfortable and therefore is very effective.  I\u2019m working at my third start-up in a row and I\u2019m finding the idea of joining yet another \u201cthriving\u201d office culture exhausting. I\u2019m not rude to anyone at work, I engage in small talk around the coffee machine and on Slack occasionally, and I\u2019m friendly with a couple of people on my team, but I\u2019m sensing a big gap between my level of involvement and that of my peers. It\u2019s not just happy hour and birthday cakes. My office has a handful of company-sponsored clubs, from murder-mystery board games to a rock-climbing club to a feminist discussion group that isn\u2019t really intersectional enough for me. My boss has invited me to several things, and when I opted out of emails from several clubs, he asked if anything was wrong. Can I keep my job and work hard at my purpose in this office without being labeled a buzzkill or antisocial? Is it enough to function well if I\u2019m clearly not a culture fit? This was quite literally the plot of a Dave Eggers book that was pooh-poohed as being unlikely, and then became a disappointing movie and then became disappointingly true. Congratulations! You\u2019re inside a lightweight rom-com dystopia!  While every office is some kind of cult, every group of people respects archetypes. Lean into being the office grump. Be the rakish yet slightly alluring \u201cbad\u201d one. \u201cI don\u2019t go for drinks after work, we already have work together, let\u2019s talk about our work during the time that we work\u201d is something I like to say at the office. Be more aggressive about who you are, not less. I was the brains behind the creation and development of a project that got approved at the company I work for, but I\u2019m not the face of it. In both company acknowledgments and in the press, it\u2019s become apparent that the person who is the face is claiming credit for developing the idea, with me almost as a secondary creator, rather than the primary one. How do you navigate this situation when they are people you work closely with? There\u2019s no real way to bring this up without being petty, and yet I also think this is how resentment begins and builds. If you are at the office for your own amusement, maybe then this is \u201chow resentment begins.\u201d You have lost the entire point of going to work. Your entire career, which means the structure of your life \u2014 your age at retirement, the city you will eventually live in, the way you feel about yourself \u2014 may hinge on this moment. Being casual about capitalism misses the whole point.  Capitalism is like a vat of boiling oil. Sure, you\u2019d rather not be in the vat at all. But there\u2019s nothing worse than being halfway submerged. Right now, you\u2019re watching half your body boil away while still awake. You put yourself just half in the vat, and you\u2019re worried about being petty? You need to blow way past petty. My boss is a very attractive woman who has been giving me pretty clear signs she wants to have sex with me. No threats or coercion involved, just plain lust. She\u2019s no female version of Harvey Weinstein, and I know I\u2019d enjoy it. What\u2019s the downside? There is no downside whatsoever here and that sounds completely fine.

{"content": "For 53 years, Tommy Rowles asked \u201cWhat are you having?\u201d to the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Paul McCartney and anyone else who bellied up to the bar he presided over. Some of them ordered a Tommy Rowles; after he had worked there for a while, a rum-and-cognac concoction named for him was added to the drink menu. The place was Bemelmans Bar, in the Carlyle hotel in Manhattan. Mr. Rowles, who worked there until he retired in 2012, died on Nov. 11 at age 78. His daughter, Sharon Connelly, confirmed the death. She said Mr. Rowles had dementia. On the job at Bemelmans Bar, known for its murals by the artist Ludwig Bemelmans and its little tables with their little lights, Mr. Rowles mixed and poured for the famous and the influential. But whatever secrets they imparted, he kept. His guiding principle was that what happened in Bemelmans stayed in Bemelmans. Still, he had a repertoire of stories that said a great deal without saying very much. He admitted to having shaken hands with John F. Kennedy. \u201cI served Bobby and Teddy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not Jack. When they know they\u2019re running, they don\u2019t go into bars.\u201d And he often told of an early incident. It involved his fourth customer, former President Harry S. Truman. (And no, Mr. Rowles would not say who the first three were.) \u201cI didn\u2019t know the protocol of talking to a Mr. President,\u201d he recalled in \u201cAlways at the Carlyle,\u201d a recent documentary directed by Matthew Miele. \u201cI said, \u2018Harry, would you like a little drink?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Rowles\u2019s boss overheard the question and was not happy that the former president had been addressed by his first name. \u201cHe\u2019s Mr. President to you,\u201d his boss fumed. \u201cYou will not be here long.\u201d But Truman overheard that, and intervened. \u201cI told that young man to call me by my name,\u201d he told the boss, who said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, very sorry, Mr. President. O.K., Tommy, go ahead.\u201d \u201cIf he didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Rowles recalled, \u201cthey were going to let me go.\u201d Mr. Rowles said Truman had ordered an Old Grand-Dad bourbon, and when Mr. Rowles told him he could never drink that, the former president said, \u201cWell, take a look outside and tell me what you see.\u201d Mr. Rowles left his post in the windowless bar. \u201cI looked outside and saw these reporters with cameras and microphones,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I says, \u2018I see a lot of reporters.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes, and if you had to walk 15 blocks with these guys following you, you\u2019d drink this, too.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Rowles was born in Dublin on May 30, 1940. His father, Thomas, died when he was 2, and he said his mother, Winifred, worked at three or four jobs. \u201cShe taught English literature,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they paid her more to clean houses than to teach.\u201d In addition to his daughter, Mr. Rowles is survived by a sister, Helen Doyle, and a granddaughter. A brother, Dick, died this year. He left Ireland for New York when he was 18. In the classified ads of The Irish Echo, he found a room for rent at Madison Avenue and 96th Street. Then he set out to find a job in a bar. He wandered somewhere \u2014 sometimes he said he had headed down Fifth Avenue, barless for miles; sometimes he said he had walked down Madison without seeing any bars he could apply to. He said that when he went into the Carlyle, on Madison 20 blocks from his apartment, he was looking for a bathroom because he had been out late the night before, drinking beer. He started talking with the man behind the bar. \u201cI said I\u2019d like to be a bar boy,\u201d Mr. Rowles recalled in 2012. \u201cHe said, \u2018We call them bartenders over here.\u2019 \u201d Then he told Mr. Rowles to report for work the next day. Toward the end of his career, having made thousands of martinis, Mr. Rowles said there was a right way to make one. \u201cMy secret is to forget about the vermouth,\u201d he told FT Magazine, a weekly supplement of the British newspaper Financial Times. \u201cI don\u2019t know why people put it in.

{"content": "Pablo Ferro, who with quick cuts, hand lettering and a bundle of innovative ideas put a jolt into the often drab world of movies\u2019 opening credits, died on Nov. 16 in Sedona, Ariz. He was 83. The cause was complications of pneumonia, his son, Allen, said. Mr. Ferro burst into the film business in 1964 with his attention-getting title sequence for \u201cDr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,\u201d Stanley Kubrick\u2019s nuclear-age black comedy. His hand-lettered titles, full of incongruous sizes (the gigantic \u201cA\u201d in \u201cA STANLEY KUBRICK PRODUCTION\u201d dwarfed the other words), appeared over footage of aircraft refueling in midflight. In a 2009 article about groundbreakers in Mr. Ferro\u2019s profession, The New York Times called it \u201cthe title sequence that inspired a thousand hand-drawn title sequences.\u201d Dozens of films followed, many of them Oscar contenders, including \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d (1993) and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d (1997). In 2009, presenting him its highest award, AIGA, the professional design association, recognized Mr. Ferro for \u201cchanging our visual expectations and demonstrating the power of design to enhance storytelling.\u201d Pablo Francisco Ferro was born on Jan. 15, 1935, in Antilla, Cuba. His father, Jos\u00e9, was a dentist, and his mother, Isabel (Rivas) Ferro, was a homemaker. \u201cEverywhere I went I drew pictures,\u201d he said of his childhood in \u201cPablo,\u201d a 2012 documentary about him directed by Richard Goldgewicht. The family moved to New York City when Pablo was 12. His father left two years later, according to the documentary, and Pablo went to work at whatever jobs he could find to help his mother support the family. One job was as an usher at a movie house that showed foreign films, and a love of cinema took hold. He was also teaching himself animation from a book, and after graduating from the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) in the early 1950s, he began working alongside Stan Lee drawing science fiction comics. Soon, though, he transitioned to television commercials. \u201cMost of the artists in comics stayed with the comics most of their lives,\u201d Mr. Lee, who died four days before Mr. Ferro did, said in the documentary. \u201cThe fact that Pablo was able to go from comic book art to directing commercials \u2014 that was a tribute to Pablo\u2019s talent.\u201d Allen Ferro, himself a graphic designer and director, said one of his father\u2019s strengths was becoming adept at all the jobs required for any given project, whether creating graphics, animating or directing, a lesson he passed along. \u201cHe was a warrior when it came to being diversified in skill sets,\u201d the son said. \u201cHe imbued in most of us the necessity and responsibility of understanding each of the departments that were in your industry.\u201d In 1961 Mr. Ferro, Fred Mogubgub and Lew Schwartz formed a commercial production partnership that within a year was drawing attention with visually jazzy commercials that shook up what had been a bland business. \u201cAmong the few hopeful producers working diligently and with signs of success to inject novelty and a species of art into the message from our sponsor are Ferro, Mogubgub and Schwartz,\u201d The New York Times wrote in 1962. Mr. Ferro\u2019s fast-moving commercials, mixing stills, film clips and animation, caught the eye of Kubrick, who was making \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201d \u201cHe saw my reel, and he wanted me to do his trailer, even though I have never done a trailer before,\u201d Mr. Ferro said in the documentary. The trailer he produced, a blizzard of written words and images, led to the invitation to do the title sequence as well. The film installed Mr. Ferro among a group of artists who had begun to experiment with ways to make title sequences convey more than just who worked on the movie. Saul Bass became a pioneer with his sequence for the 1955 film \u201cThe Man With the Golden Arm,\u201d and others, like Stephen Frankfurt (\u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d 1962), were also using opening credits to set a tone and heighten expectations. Mr. Ferro worked with top directors like Norman Jewison, Jonathan Demme, Barry Sonnenfeld and Hal Ashby, who became a close friend. In 1971 he received another assignment from Mr. Kubrick: to make the trailer for \u201cA Clockwork Orange.\u201d The phrase \u201cquick cut\u201d seems inadequate to describe the result, which remains visually startling almost a half-century later, its words and images coming at the viewer so fast as to be almost unabsorbable. \u201cOne time I was accused of subliminal advertising,\u201d Mr. Ferro said of his fondness for that technique. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Pablo, I\u2019m sure somewhere in there there\u2019s a frame that says \u2018Hire Pablo.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Ferro was not limited to titles and trailers; directors tapped his expertise in other aspects of the filmmaking process. For \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair,\u201d the slick 1968 Steve McQueen thriller, Mr. Jewison, the director, wanted to shorten the movie and sought Mr. Ferro\u2019s editing help. Mr. Ferro used a multiple-screen effect that has since become commonplace but was new at the time. He did not receive an editing credit, but his contribution was later widely cited. \u201cFerro cut a key scene known as the \u2018polo sequence\u2019 into 20 or 30 simultaneous frames, reducing the time from six minutes to around 40 seconds,\u201d Steven Heller, an expert in graphic design, wrote in the magazine Eye in 1999. \u201cBut in addition to compression, certain important character traits were brought out by the way in which he designed and paced the multiples. By focusing on clothes, for instance, Ferro underscored the wealth and sophistication of the people in the specific scene.\u201d Mr. Ferro\u2019s marriage to Susan Fridolfs ended in divorce. In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Joy Moore; a brother, Jos\u00e9; three sisters, Flora, Bertha and Maria; and two grandchildren. He lived in Sedona. In a 2002 interview with The Chicago Tribune, Mr. Ferro explained why he invested so much effort in opening credits. \u201cThe title sequence is the story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the introduction to the movie. It\u2019s telling you what kind of feeling you\u2019re going to get into. If you fail doing that, the whole movie falls apart.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/obituaries/pablo-ferro-dead.html", "date": "2018-11-21 00:00:00", "author": "By Neil Genzlinger", "description": "Beginning with \u201cDr. Strangelove,\u201d he found attention-getting ways to make title sequences more than just a list of names.", "title": "Pablo Ferro, Who Energized Films\u2019 Opening Credits, Dies at 83"},
{"content": "Yesterday, Xiang Kai, a director and writer based in Shanghai, burned more than $20,000 worth of Dolce & Gabbana products, including coats, a vest and bags. A previous fan of the brand, he said he also threw his shoes and watches from the label in the trash.  \u201cThe purpose of burning my clothes is to awaken the Chinese people and the Chinese nation,\u201d said Mr. Xiang, who posted photos online of his products in flames. \u201cSome people say you\u2019ve wasted a lot of money. I\u2019m willing to waste this money for the nation\u2019s dignity.\u201d He was among an untold number of people who have revolted against the Italian fashion brand that built its reputation on the ability to make Sicilian widows\u2019 weeds sexy. Earlier this week, the company released video clips widely seen as racist, pandering to old stereotypes (they featured a Chinese model being taught to eat spaghetti, pizza and a cannoli with chopsticks) in advance of a planned extravaganza of a show in Shanghai. Then Stefano Gabbana, a company co-founder and designer, appears to have engaged in a bout of insulting name-calling (including suggesting that the Chinese eat dogs) with a critic on Instagram. Mr. Gabbana said his account was hacked. Someday this still escalating debacle may form the body of a new industry fable, one with a moral about the dangers of ill-considered direct communication, the swift retribution of the crowd and the hazards of cultural arrogance. But right now the story\u2019s most striking revelation is what happens when a history of playground-bullying online meets the economic force of the fastest-growing, most important and very autocratic luxury market.  The dominoes begin to fall. The pigeons come home to roost. The rats abandon the sinking ship. You become a veritable paragon of clich\u00e9s! And a cautionary tale. After all, in the four days since, the brand has, in no short order: Net-a-Porter, the luxury e-tailer headquartered in London and owned by Richemont, has removed all Dolce products from their Chinese website. Lucky Blue Smith, a model/influencer with 3.2 million followers on Instagram who has become a millennial Dolce staple, posted a note on his account explaining his decision to skip the show that read in part, \u201cWe are all gods children and we should all be treating EVERYONE, EVERY CULTURE with respect. I will be back to China soon \u2014 love you all so much.\u201d And apparently fearful of damage by association, fellow Italian brand MaxMara made a proactive statement Thursday on its WeChat account, stating \u201cChina, you\u2019re the best! I love you, homeland!\u201d Various fashion brands have been previously accused of cultural mistakes or insults. Australians took Chanel to task for its sale of a luxury boomerang. Zara was accused of using Nazi and alt-right hate symbolism on their products. Just this week Dior came under fire for ads featuring Jennifer Lawrence while purporting to celebrate Mexican heritage. Still, the Dolce incident is the first time this kind of misstep has had such global repercussions. Spokespeople for Secoo and Net-a-Porter could not remember either company ever dropping a brand for such reasons before. As Angelica Cheung, the editor of Vogue China, wrote in an email, \u201cThis case is a wake-up call: a 1.4 billion population is for sure a huge consumption power, but if you don\u2019t get it right, hundreds of millions of people voicing their outrage on social media is a powerful force, hard to ignore.\u201d Dolce & Gabbana released three statements, first saying its accounts had been hacked, then offering words of support for the people who worked on the canceled show and declarations of love for China. But it wasn\u2019t until the end of the week that the founders officially apologized in a video in Mandarin. They seemed to have underestimated the importance of Chinese national identity while also overestimating their place in the wider fashion ecosystem. \u201cThe consumer is more selfish right now in feeling that China has a rich history and culture and is now a world power \u2014 that we know we are your most important customer base and you need to respect them,\u201d said Ben Cavender, a senior analyst at China Market Research, a consultancy based in Shanghai. According to the Boston Consulting Group, Chinese consumers are currently responsible for 32 percent of luxury goods sales worldwide, a number expected to grow to 40 percent by 2024, at which point the Chinese will drive 75 percent of the growth of the global market. The hacking excuse, which could have been accepted at face value as a way for supporters to embrace the brand, has had almost no traction, in part because of Mr. Gabbana\u2019s history of hitting back at any criticism of the brand on his Instagram feed. Though traditionally the brand has seemed impervious to such controversies \u2014 indeed, has seemed to thrive on being politically incorrect \u2014 this time is different. In the eyes of many in the international community, Mr. Gabbana has become the designer who cried wolf. You can\u2019t take on everyone from Selena Gomez to gay parents with bluster and venom and then claim you were hacked and expect to be believed.  As Susie Bubble, a London-based critic, street style star and front-row regular, posted to her 440,000 Instagram followers, \u201cthis is yet another example of a misguided diva creative director in the upper echelons of the industry throwing his weight around and vomiting over social media in a reckless manner that impacts on a billion dollar company with thousands of employees as well as umpteen parts of the industry that would have been flown into Shanghai for what was supposed to be a media/celebrity fueled extravaganza.\u201d  Estelle Chen, the Victoria\u2019s Secret model, had a similar reaction, writing: \u201csaying your accounts (both personal and official: Dolce & Gabbana) were hacked shows how much of a coward you are. Could you please at least take responsibility for your behavior?\u201d The brand\u2019s track record of insensitivity has not helped. Dolce has been called out in recent years for labeling a $2,395 pair of shoes \u201cslave sandals\u201d (in 2016; they later changed the name to the more innocuous \u201cdecorative flat sandal\u201d) and including earrings that looked like they were made of blackamoor faces in a 2012 collection. They have also banned a number of critics from shows (The Times has not been invited to a Dolce show for over a decade; Women\u2019s Wear Daily, W magazine, Italian Vogue and Vanity Fair have also been rejected at various times). Dolce & Gabbana is also the only major Italian brand that has refused to join the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiano, Italian fashion\u2019s governing organization and lobbying group, and does not appear on the official Milan Fashion Week schedule. As a result, Carlo Capasa, the president of the Camera della Moda, which has always been fiercely protective of Italian brands and industry and which might have been expected to come to the brand\u2019s defense, simply said he couldn\u2019t make a statement about the situation because Dolce was not a member. The Chinese government, though, seems to be taking steps to try to tone down the reaction. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, when asked about the controversy, said: \u201cThe Chinese side does not want this matter to rise to a diplomatic issue.\u201d Chinese state media also sought to limit the fallout. Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times, called on consumers to be \u201cmore open-minded.\u201d \u201cDolce & Gabbana was undoubtedly wrong, but sins do not equate to death,\u201d Mr. Hu wrote on Friday on his Weibo account. Mr. Cavender, the analyst, was not so sure. \u201cThe reality is this is probably going to kill growth for them,\u201d he said. The last time a consumer boycott erupted on this scale in China was in 2017 over South Korea\u2019s embrace of an American missile defense system that China feared could be used to spy on its territory. Back then, protesters besieged branches of Lotte Mart, a South Korean supermarket chain.

{"content": "Arlo SoHo is a trendy hotel in West SoHo. It has a spacious backyard that is set up like a glamping site. There are tents, picnic tables, Adirondack chairs, trees. There is also an ice cream cart. At first glance the ice cream looks normal. But you might want to pace yourself: This innocent-looking treat can have up to 5 percent alcohol content per scoop. Made by the New York-based company Tipsy Scoop, which has a store near Gramercy Park, the ice cream comes in flavors like strawberry rhubarb bourbon or cake batter vodka martini. The hotel also serves elaborate ice-cream cocktails made by Muddling Memories, a beverage company based in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The Floating Through Life, for example, includes vanilla bean bourbon ice cream, strawberry rhubarb bourbon ice cream, bourbon, elderflower, ginger beer, edible flowers and is topped with lemon meringue cookies. The Arlo is one of many places where New Yorkers are indulging in boozy ice cream. Here is a look at the trend. What Is it? Boozy ice cream is \u201cany ice cream that incorporates liquor, wine, or beer in its ingredients,\u201d said Ali Rosen, the cookbook author and television host. But it\u2019s actually hard to pull off. Because liquor has a lower freezing point than milk, too much of it can warm ice cream, making it melt. \u201cMostly it is used for its flavor,\u201d Ms. Rosen said. Where did it come from?  \u201cRum raisin was popular starting in the 1930s,\u201d Ms. Rosen said. \u201cA 1947 copy I have of the \u2018Boston Cooking-School Cookbook\u2019 has an ice cream recipe with brandy.\u201d But there are a few reasons the decadent treat is popular now. Ice cream used to be the product of large corporations, which had to work within the confines of changing liquor laws, so it was easier for big companies to avoid alcohol altogether, Ms. Rosen said. It is perfectly legal, though, for businesses to prepare foods with small amounts of alcohol (5 percent or below) without the need of a liquor license, although these products should not be sold to customers under the age of 21, according to the New York State Liquor Authority. Meanwhile smaller shops like Tipsy Scoop also have the freedom to collaborate with bars and hotels that have liquor licenses to intensify the booze factor. Where Can I Find It? OddFellows Ice Cream Co., based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, makes quirky flavors like tequila pineapple and absinthe chocolate chip \u2014 all with a negligible amount of alcohol \u2014 in its three shops in Williamsburg, the East Village and NoLIta. For its new location in Dumbo, the company is applying for a liquor license in order to make the truly boozy stuff. Il Laboratorio del Gelato, on the Lower East Side, also has a few tame selections flavored with alcohol, including Kahl\u00faa, Sambuca and Nocello, as well as a prosecco sorbet. A short walk away is Morgenstern\u2019s Finest Ice Cream, known for its cinnamon whiskey flavor. The restaurant Dante, in the West Village, is offering an Aperol popsicle (made by OddFellows) that comes with a shot of Aperol spritz. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get you drunk by any means,\u201d said Nick Matus, a bartender there. \u201cBut it\u2019s delicious.\u201d But Isn\u2019t It Better Just to Have a Drink? Carly Petrone, 38, a writer and social media manager, tried Tipsy Scoop\u2019s margarita ice cream and fell in love with it immediately. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fun way to meet up for happy hour with friends, especially in the summer when it\u2019s so hot outside,\u201d she said. Noe Jose, 25, a marketing director who lives on the Lower East Side, said his friends get tired of drinking the same old cocktails. \u201cI\u2019m in the events business and not everyone wants to drink all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can reinvent the way people consume alcohol.\u201d What about the purity of the experience? \u201cI think the only downside is sometimes certain liquors come across too much in some flavors, which makes it hard to eat more than a few bites,\u201d Ms. Petrone said. So it also could be off-putting to certain ice cream snobs. It\u2019s also more expensive than regular ice cream.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/nyregion/booze-and-ice-cream-in-one-fell-scoop.html", "date": "2018-08-28 00:00:00", "author": "By Alyson Krueger", "description": "Want to really indulge on a hot summer night?

{"content": "Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s emphasis on small donors in last year\u2019s mayoral race helped fuel a resurgence of donations of $175 or less to candidates participating in New York City\u2019s matching funds program, according to a new report by the Campaign Finance Board. The report says that 73 percent of contributors to the mayoral campaigns participating in the program \u2014 primarily the campaigns of Mr. Blasio, who was elected to a second term, and his Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis \u2014 made donations in that range. Donations of $175 or less by city residents are eligible to receive a six-to-one match of publicly financed campaign cash, creating an incentive for candidates to reach out to small donors. Four years earlier, just 48 percent of contributors to participating candidates made donations at that level, while in 2009, 70 percent of donors gave in that range, according to the report. The sharp fluctuation may be because in 2013 there was no incumbent running and, according to the report, candidates in a wide-open race may focus more on soliciting big-money donors. Mr. de Blasio altered his fund-raising strategy last year to place a greater emphasis on small donors, in part because state and federal investigations into his fund-raising practices had trained an embarrassing spotlight on his relationship with big-money donors who did business with the city. The investigations, which ended without any charges being filed, also made some big donors uneasy about giving money to the mayor. Under the matching funds program, which is intended to magnify the importance of smaller contributions, if a city resident donates $10 to a campaign that qualifies for matching funds, the candidate gets $70. Amy M. Loprest, the executive director of the campaign finance board, said that the high percentage of small contributors shows the system is working. \u201cThe campaign finance program continues to provide the incentive to candidates to reach out to voters to give small contributions and it gives the contributors the incentive to give to those candidates,\u201d she said. Citing a study showing that people who gave money to candidates were much more likely to vote, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important part of civic engagement that you provide the incentives for individuals to become contributors.\u201d The board\u2019s report comes as a charter revision commission created by Mr. de Blasio is preparing to send proposals to city voters that would change the campaign finance system. The commission is proposing to increase the public funds match to eight to one, while changing the donation limits. In citywide races, such as mayor and public advocate, the match would apply to the first $250 donated by city residents. The current $175 threshold for matching funds would continue to apply to donations to City Council and borough president candidates, under the commission\u2019s proposals. The commission is expected to meet in September to finalize its recommendations. Currently, the city\u2019s campaign finance system is enumerated in laws passed by the City Council. The commission would enshrine the system, along with the new limits, in the City Charter, which functions as a kind of constitution for city government. The charter commission has also proposed lowering the maximum allowable contributions significantly. Under its proposals, donors to mayoral candidates taking part in the matching funds program could give no more than $2,000 to a candidate; in the last election, the maximum donation was $4,950. It would also set lower maximum donation limits for candidates to other offices. The report from the Campaign Finance Board, which is required to produce an analysis every four years, calls for similar changes to the matching funds program. It argues that the changes are needed before the 2021 election, when no incumbents will be running for mayor or other citywide posts and most City Council seats will be up for grabs because of term limits. Those conditions will be similar to the 2009 race, when the percentage of smaller contributions dipped and the importance of large donations jumped. The proposed changes would further bolster the influence of small donors, the report said. Yet even last year, with its high percentage of small donors, large contributors continued to carry outsize weight in the election, according to the board report. The board reported that 13,767 people made donations of $175 or less to mayoral candidates participating in the matching program, for a total of $783,699. In contrast, 656 people gave the maximum donation of $4,950, for total contributions of $3.2 million. The board also found that for the first time ever, political campaigns in the city took in more donations made by credit card than by check, a sign of how online fund-raising is changing the way campaigns reach out to donors. In total, Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Malliotakis received $5.9 million in matching funds. Several other candidates participated in the program during the primaries, but none of them raised enough money to qualify for matching funds (the program requires candidates to reach certain fund-raising levels in order to receive the funds). Other candidates, such as Bo Dietl, who ran as an independent, did not participate.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/nyregion/small-donors-mayor-election-nyc-de-blasio.html", "date": "2018-08-30 00:00:00", "author": "By William Neuman", "description": "Nearly 75 percent of donors to last year\u2019s mayoral race in New York City gave $175 or less, a much higher share than in the 2013 election.", "title": "Influence of Big-Money Donors Declined in 2017 Mayoral Election"},
{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Before resigning as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency this year, Scott Pruitt delighted President Trump with his zeal for proclaiming sweeping regulatory rollbacks, even though he left behind a trail of courtroom setbacks. Andrew R. Wheeler, a former energy lobbyist whom Mr. Trump plans to nominate to lead the E.P.A., has been quietly cleaning up the mess. Where virtually all of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s hastily written rollbacks and suspensions have been blocked by the courts, Mr. Wheeler has taken a far more deliberative approach, immersing himself in the legal intricacies \u2014 a strategy that could make Mr. Wheeler one of the most effective drivers of the Trump administration\u2019s ambitious plan to rewrite the nation\u2019s rule book on the environment and climate. \u201cHe\u2019s done a fantastic job,\u201d Mr. Trump said Friday of Mr. Wheeler, who has served as the E.P.A.\u2019s acting administrator since Mr. Pruitt stepped down in July amid a wave of ethics scandals. Supporters say the White House sees in Mr. Wheeler the anti-Pruitt: drama-free, low-key, and, most importantly, able to get the proposed rollbacks through the courts. In doing this, however, Mr. Wheeler has already found himself at odds not only with conservative groups but others within his own administration. But these tensions underscored what many say is the essential difference between Mr. Trump\u2019s first and second choices for E.P.A. chief: Where Mr. Pruitt sought the limelight, Mr. Wheeler sweats the details. And that could make him a far more formidable weapon than his predecessor in the Trump administration\u2019s vast reshaping of environmental and climate rules. \u201cAndy Wheeler is one of the few calm spots in the turbulent seas of this executive branch,\u201d said Scott Segal, a fossil fuel lobbyist for Bracewell who has worked closely with Mr. Wheeler. \u201cThat must come as a pretty welcome relief to this White House.\u201d He also has \u201csufficient process understanding to make that agenda stick,\u201d Mr. Segal added. This summer, for instance, the E.P.A. took steps to replace the Clean Power Plan, a major Obama administration policy designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The new version of the plan is significantly weaker.  But Mr. Pruitt had wanted to eliminate the program entirely, while Mr. Wheeler, according to several industry sources, insisted that the government was legally obligated to have a climate plan. Therefore, eliminating the Clean Power Plan without replacing it could be challenged in court and leave an opening for even tougher regulations under a future Democratic president. \u201cI got phone calls from conservatives wanting to know, \u2018Why did we do anything? Why are we putting forward a proposal at all?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wheeler acknowledged in an interview last week. His argument, that more restrictive replacement is better than killing off the climate regulation entirely, won the day. Then, in August, the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department moved to gut another major federal effort to combat climate change by relaxing rules aimed at reducing car tailpipe pollution. The Trump administration plan also voided California\u2019s ability to set its own, stricter standards, triggering a potentially ugly legal battle between Washington and blue states over the ability to fight global warming. Mr. Wheeler, according to several people involved in the discussions, pushed back forcefully against an analysis used by highway officials to justify the rollback, which argued that stricter fuel pollution rules would cause thousands of deaths in road accidents. The agency argued that  more efficient cars are less safe because they are lighter. People who have attended meetings with Mr. Wheeler said he argued that the fatality numbers relied on bad calculations and were likely to be successfully challenged in court.  Mr. Wheeler on Friday denied that he had clashed with Jeffrey A. Rosen, the chief Transportation Department architect of the auto-standards rollback, saying he merely sought to understand his colleagues\u2019 mathematical modeling and legal reasoning. \u201cI wanted to make sure what we were putting forward would be upheld in the courts, and he assured me that the work they had done would be,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. A department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said on Tuesday that there was \u201cno dispute\u201d between the agencies. Mr. Wheeler\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Pruitt, faced more than a dozen federal investigations into his conduct, including his extensive use of first-class air travel, renting a condo from the wife of an energy lobbyist with business before the E.P.A. and enlisting aides on personal tasks like buying a used mattress from Trump International Hotel and seeking a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife. The grandson of a coal miner and an Ohio native, Mr. Wheeler studied biology in college and got his first job after law school in the 1990s working at the E.P.A.\u2019s office of pollution prevention and toxics. He later worked in the Senate for 14 years, most of that time for Senator James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who has denied the established science of climate change.  During that time, Mr. Pruitt was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Senator Inhofe. The senator last week said he strongly supported Mr. Wheeler\u2019s nomination. As an energy lobbyist since 2009, Mr. Wheeler\u2019s top client was Robert E. Murray, the chief executive of one of the country\u2019s largest coal companies, a fierce opponent of E.P.A. climate change regulations and a denier of established climate science.  Asked last week to describe his understanding of the best available science on global warming, Mr. Wheeler said: \u201cI think climate change is happening. Man has an impact. CO2 has an impact.\u201d  It\u2019s not a full acceptance of the scientific consensus that humans are the dominant cause of rising global temperatures. But it\u2019s closer to it than the positions of Mr. Pruitt, who falsely claimed that there was \u201ctremendous disagreement\u201d among scientists about how great a role humans play in driving warming, or Mr. Trump, who said \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s man-made.\u201d Still, Mr. Wheeler argued, sweeping regulations, like the plan put forth by the Obama administration to force a shift toward renewable energy by asking states to reduce emissions from coal plants, would have \u201cbasically ended the coal industry in the United States.\u201d \u201cPeople have to realize the use of coal worldwide has not peaked,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. Since taking over as acting E.P.A. administrator, Mr. Wheeler has replaced Mr. Pruitt\u2019s artwork of Henry Clay, a former senator and secretary of state, with wall hangings of the Senate roll call vote for a highway spending bill he helped pass in 2005 and the bronze medals he earned for budgetary work at E.P.A. in the 1990s. He said he has not needed to use the $43,000 secure phone booth Mr. Pruitt installed. He also has made a point of being more deeply involved in the agency\u2019s inner workings. He visited all 10 of the E.P.A.\u2019s regional offices at the start of his tenure and has involved the agency\u2019s longtime career employees in policy meetings, things Mr. Pruitt hadn\u2019t done. Moves like these have won praise from some of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s fiercest critics.  \u201cHe\u2019s somebody that respects the institution of the E.P.A.,\u201d Kevin Minoli, the E.P.A.\u2019s former top ethics counsel who had called for investigations into Mr. Pruitt, said of Mr. Wheeler. That hasn\u2019t endeared him to environmental groups, however. In fact, many say Mr. Wheeler\u2019s softer touch has made it harder to focus the public\u2019s attention on his weakening of clean air and water laws. \u201cIn some ways Pruitt distracted from some of the very negative things that were going on in environmental law, but in other ways there was a lot of attention being paid to E.P.A.,\u201d said Conrad Schneider, advocacy director for the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental nonprofit organization. Analysts on both sides say Mr. Wheeler is more pragmatic than his predecessor and more disciplined. Where Mr. Pruitt would throw his energy into ideological battles, like trying to create support for a military-style televised debate of climate science, Mr. Wheeler has eschewed the limelight and strategically focused on a handful of major policy initiatives.  Under Mr. Wheeler\u2019s watch, the E.P.A. has moved forward with rolling back or weakening every major Obama-era climate change regulation. In addition to the proposal to loosen car pollution rules, those moves include replacing a landmark effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants with a plan that the agency says will see air pollution actually rise, and reducing limits on methane pollution, a powerful greenhouse gas, from oil and gas wells. He also has focused on work begun by Mr. Pruitt to revise Mr. Obama\u2019s clean water regulation, known as the Waters of the United State rule, saying on Friday that the revisions \u201cwill be coming out soon.\u201d He has taken on an effort to weaken and perhaps repeal a 2011 rule that limits mercury, a toxic chemical that is emitted from coal plants.  And, while he has pushed back to 2020 a plan initiated by Mr. Pruitt to impose broad new restrictions on the types of scientific research the E.P.A. uses to write regulations, he said he fully intended to finalize it. Emails obtained by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group, have found that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s political staff excluded the E.P.A.\u2019s chief science adviser from helping to design the rule. The group says the absence of scientists in the writing of the regulation undermined the administration\u2019s argument that the proposal was done in the interest of science.  \u201cWhich is why we\u2019re taking our time with it now,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. \u201cIt was proposed before I got here.\u201d  However, under Mr. Wheeler, the E.P.A. also has eliminated the office of chief science adviser.  \u201cBy word and deed, Wheeler is proving to be as bad and dangerous as Pruitt,\u201d said John Walke, clean air director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Conservatives see Mr. Wheeler and his predecessor in a different light. Among them is Myron Ebell, who led Mr. Trump\u2019s E.P.A. transition team. \u201cPruitt was an outstanding advocate for the Trump agenda, and now it\u2019s up to Andy Wheeler to be the outstanding implementer of the Trump agenda,\u201d Mr. Ebell said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/climate/andrew-wheeler-epa.html", "date": "2018-11-21 00:00:00", "author": "By Lisa Friedman", "description": "President Trump\u2019s current choice to run the E.P.A., Andrew Wheeler, could emerge as an effective and efficient driver of the administration\u2019s environmental and climate deregulation agenda.", "title": "Scott Pruitt\u2019s Environmental Rollbacks Stumbled in Court.

{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump released an exclamation-point-filled statement on Tuesday about the assassination of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi. It took him some time to get to Mr. Khashoggi. But bear with it. The statement is a fascinating journey into the mind of the president. Mr. Trump, when he is not obfuscating, is sometimes startlingly transparent about why he makes decisions. Here is the president\u2019s statement, as released by the White House, with additional context.  Well, indeed it is! But not so dangerous, perhaps, that one should expect to be assassinated in a consulate while going to collect paperwork for a wedding. Mr. Trump, here, is trying to remind the public who the United States\u2019 real enemy is. Hint: It is not Saudi Arabia. Riyadh\u2019s strong support for the Trump administration\u2019s hard line on Iran is a prime reason that the White House has maintained support for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler. The Iranian government has been prone to shout the equivalent of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d But officials say Iranian terrorist activity is down recently. Tehran is seeking to keep Europe on board with the 2015 nuclear deal, from which the Trump administration withdrew. Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster that has created the worst famine the country has seen. Despite calls from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a cease-fire, Saudi Arabia has stepped up its military operations. The Saudi military\u2019s lack of discipline and planning in its airstrikes has resulted in high numbers of civilian casualties, according to American officials. Regional experts say the Trump administration\u2019s most decisive action against Saudi Arabia so far has been to cut off aerial refueling flights for Riyadh\u2019s military campaign in Yemen. This is a prime example of Mr. Trump\u2019s brutally transactional foreign policy. He is supporting Saudi Arabia because he thinks it is critical for the United States\u2019 defense industry. Saudi Arabia spends huge amounts on its military, and the United States is a beneficiary. However, the president\u2019s numbers are exaggerated. Trouble in the Saudi economy has led the government to slow roll some of the pledges to buy high-ticket items, including the missile defense system known as Thaad.  Baloney! The Saudis cannot hang a Russian or Chinese bomb on American-built F-15s or Apache gunships. They don\u2019t fit. Won\u2019t work. Saudi Arabia has heavily invested in American-made and NATO-standard weapons. Where do you get munitions and spare parts for those planes and helicopters? The United States. Here, at last, we get to Mr. Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident who was assassinated last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The Trump administration\u2019s sanctions have mostly targeted the members of the Saudi kill team who traveled to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi. Interestingly, the administration\u2019s list included Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to Prince Mohammed, but it did not include Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, who Saudi officials said masterminded the plot to confront Mr. Khashoggi in the consulate on Oct. 2. Mr. Trump is repeating some of the phrases that the Saudi government has used to discredit Mr. Khashoggi. The president is pointedly not rebutting those claims, just saying his decision is not based on them. Arguably, he is being a bit backhanded. Who knows! Can we ever really know what happened behind closed doors? Mr. Trump is clearly waiting for the kind of evidence shown on television: a recording of the crown prince giving the order or a confession of one of the kill team members. But former intelligence officers say that is not how it works. The puzzle pieces are never all present. Even without the smoking gun, enough evidence has emerged for C.I.A. officials to conclude that Prince Mohammed gave the order, according to current and former officials. Remember who the bad guy is here! Another hint: It is not Prince Mohammed. Other presidents have often shied away from talking about what lies at the heart of the strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia \u2014 oil production and low gas prices. Not Mr. Trump. And, surprising as it may seem, he is correct about the United States being the world\u2019s largest oil producer.

{"content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Tim Miller, a longtime Republican political operative, moved to the Bay Area last year to set up a public relations shop, he brought with him tradecraft more typical of Washington than Silicon Valley. He was well versed in opposition research \u2014 the pursuit of damaging intelligence about a political enemy. He had ties to online media provocateurs. And, above all, he understood the value of secrecy. Mr. Miller had arrived at the right moment with his company, Definers Public Affairs. With customers and lawmakers questioning the avowed good intentions and power of tech\u2019s biggest companies, Facebook and others were on the defensive. Definers quickly found plenty of business, from start-ups like Lyft, Lime and Juul to giants like Facebook and Qualcomm, the influential chip company that was in a nasty legal fight with Apple over royalties, according to five people with direct knowledge of Mr. Miller\u2019s work who declined to be named because of confidentiality agreements. While working for Qualcomm, Definers pushed the idea that Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was a viable presidential candidate in 2020, according to a former Definers employee and digital records. Presumably, it was an attempt to chill the cordial relations that Mr. Cook had cultivated with the Trump administration. The campaign by Definers signaled an escalation of Silicon Valley\u2019s already brass-knuckled approach to public relations. \u201cThis type of dirty P.R.? It\u2019s always been there, but it\u2019s definitely on the upswing,\u201d said Jonathan Hirshon, who was a public relations representative for technology companies for three decades, including Apple and Sony. \u201cThe idealism is still there, but the truth is, the big companies have become a lot more authoritarian in their approach to the media.\u201d Facebook fired Definers last week after The New York Times detailed the work Mr. Miller\u2019s firm had done on behalf of the social media company. Definers encouraged reporters to write about the financial connections between anti-Facebook activists and the liberal financier George Soros, drawing accusations that it was relying on anti-Semitic tropes. Definers\u2019s strategy played to a target\u2019s pressure points. Most of what Definers produced for Qualcomm had nothing to do with its beef with Apple, which was a complex legal fight over the royalties Apple should pay for the Qualcomm chips it was using in iPhones. Definers employees distributed anti-Apple research to reporters and would not say who was paying for it. Definers distributed a 13-page memo titled \u201cApple Bowing to Chinese Cyber Regulators\u201d that detailed how Apple\u2019s activity in China contradicted its public stance on privacy elsewhere. It also planted dozens of negative articles about Apple on conservative news sites, according to a person familiar with the work and emails reviewed by The New York Times. Qualcomm officials did not respond to requests for comment. The feuds among the tech industry\u2019s giants have hardly been genteel over the years. Big companies often tip reporters to bad news about other companies and urge regulators to examine competitors. A campaign by Microsoft, referred to as \u201cScroogled,\u201d highlighted what it called Google\u2019s privacy violations. From 2012 to 2014, it took out print and television ads that claimed Google was reading people\u2019s emails, a charge the internet company denied. Google has more recently been targeted with negative stories tipped to reporters by a group called the Campaign for Accountability. The group was quietly funded by the database maker Oracle, which has spent years in an intellectual property court fight with Google over Java, a programming tool owned by Oracle. Matt Rhoades, Definers\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the firm\u2019s work \u201cis absolutely no different than what public affairs firms do every day for their clients across industries and issues across the country. We are proud of the work we do for our clients.\u201d Juul, which has been accused of marketing its e-cigarettes to children, is working with Definers to improve its public image and communicate with reporters. The ride-hailing company Lyft used Definers to help navigate regulatory challenges in statehouses across the country, including choosing which Lyft drivers to pitch to the media for interviews, according to a person familiar with the work. And the scooter company Lime hired Definers in August because it wanted an outside contractor to take a more aggressive tack against rivals, according to a person familiar with that work. Lyft and Lime have since ended their work with Definers. Some details of Definers\u2019s relationships with tech firms, including Lyft and Lime, have previously been reported by other news organizations. Definers also plied its services for Washington. It helped set up Power the Future, a pro-oil trade group, while it also worked for the Environmental Protection Agency. The E.P.A. ended its contract with Definers last year after it was revealed that a Definers lawyer was investigating agency employees critical of the Trump administration. To promote clients and attack its clients\u2019 enemies, Definers regularly used NTK Network, a news aggregator with a conservative slant and 122,000 followers on Facebook. Definers and its sister firm, the political-opposition group America Rising, share some staff and one floor of an office building in Arlington, Va., with NTK. Joe Pounder, a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns who describes himself as \u201ca master of opposition research\u201d in his biographies, is listed as a co-founder of Definers and America Rising and editor in chief of NTK. Mr. Pounder and two colleagues distanced NTK from Definers after The Times\u2019s report last week. \u201cWe do not and did not work with Facebook. We share offices with a firm that does,\u201d they wrote in a blog post. But Mr. Miller promoted how Definers used NTK in a proposal sent to a potential Definers client last year, under a section labeled \u201cDigital Platform Echo Chamber.\u201d \u201cDefiners manages NTK Network, a news aggregation platform that targets Washington D.C. influencers. Through NTK we can directly re-publish favorable news from other outlets, and work with like-minded individuals to help create an echo chamber effect,\u201d he wrote in a copy of the proposal reviewed by The Times. This year, NTK has published at least 57 articles criticizing Apple and Mr. Cook. Some of the posts needled Apple for issues at the center of the legal dispute between Apple and Qualcomm and repeated Qualcomm\u2019s complaints. Apple had also started to move away from using Qualcomm chips. \u201cThe iPhone 8 Might Be Slower Than the Competition. Here\u2019s Why\u201d read a headline on an April 2017 story. NTK\u2019s answer? The iPhones don\u2019t use Qualcomm chips. Other stories were even more direct, like one from August about Qualcomm\u2019s technology that concluded: \u201cFor Apple, the choice will be clear: make nice with Qualcomm, or offer a slower, inferior product to consumers.\u201d Mr. Pounder said in a statement on Tuesday that NTK is regularly pitched by people in public relations and the media. \u201cWhat NTK writes and posts on is what NTK chooses to write and post on,\u201d he added. Definers also used other outlets to disseminate its work. In July 2017, Mr. Miller wrote an article that accused Mr. Cook of lying to President Trump about building Apple factories in the United States, according to an email reviewed by The Times. He emailed the piece to the right-wing provocateur Charles C. Johnson, according to the email, who published it on his website GotNews without a byline or other disclosures that it came from Mr. Miller, Definers or Qualcomm. Mr. Miller said in a text message to The Times that Definers pitched the angle to a range of news outlets. \u201cTwo years into the administration it\u2019s clear we were right,\u201d he added. Mr. Johnson said he had a falling out with Mr. Miller because of Mr. Miller\u2019s criticism of Mr. Trump. Definers\u2019s focus on Mr. Cook extended to a campaign it ran to promote the Apple chief as a 2020 presidential candidate. A slick website titled \u201cDraft Tim Cook 2020\u201d had digital links to Definers employees, said Kyle Ehmke, a cybersecurity researcher for the firm ThreatConnect. In a memo made public by Facebook on Wednesday, Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s communications and policy chief, assumed responsibility for hiring Definers and said Facebook asked the P.R. firm to investigate whether Mr. Soros had \u201cfinancial motivation\u201d to criticize Facebook. Mr. Schrage, a longtime confidante of Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, had already announced plans to leave Facebook. Ms. Sandberg, who had previously said she did not know about Definers, admitted in an online comment attached to the memo that she had been informed about the company in emails and other materials.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/technology/definers-public-affairs-tim-miller.html", "date": "2018-11-21 00:00:00", "author": "By Jack Nicas", "description": "Definers, an import from Washington to Silicon Valley, thrived with opposition research and a fishy campaign to push Apple\u2019s C.E.O. for president.", "title": "How Facebook\u2019s P.R.

{"content": "In \u201cRoma,\u201d the Mexican director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n uses a large canvas to tell the story of lives that some might think small. A personal epic set in Mexico City in the early 1970s, it centers on a young indigenous woman who works as a maid for a middle-class white family that\u2019s falling apart. Cuar\u00f3n uses one household on one street to open up a world, working on a panoramic scale often reserved for war stories, but with the sensibility of a personal diarist. It\u2019s an expansive, emotional portrait of life buffeted by violent forces, and a masterpiece. Few directors tell large-scale stories with as much sensitivity as Cuar\u00f3n, whose filmmaking style has grown more exhilarating as the expressive realism of his breakout movie, \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n,\u201d has been channeled into the restrained ostentation of his fantasies \u201cChildren of Men\u201d and \u201cGravity.\u201d In \u201cRoma\u201d he has further refined his style by marshaling various narrative strategies, including cinematic spectacle. Many directors use spectacle to convey larger-than-life events while reserving devices like close-ups to express a character\u2019s inner being. Here, Cuar\u00f3n uses both intimacy and monumentality to express the depths of ordinary life. \u201cRoma\u201d shares its name with a neighborhood in Mexico City where families live behind locked gates, and where maids, cooks and drivers busily keep homes running. In one such house, Cleo (the newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) lives with and works for a multigenerational brood that scarcely seems capable of doing anything without her. In the morning, she wakes the children; at night, she puts them to bed. From each dawn and until long after dusk, she tends to the family and its sprawling two-story house. She serves meals, cleans away dog droppings and carries laundry up to the roof, where she does the wash in view of other maids on other roofs with their own heavy loads. The movie opens in 1970 with scenes that establish Cleo\u2019s everyday routine and, by extension, the parameters of her life. Much of the movie takes place inside the house (a re-creation of Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s childhood home), which is flanked by a gated, open-roofed passage filled with bicycles, plants, caged birds and an exuberant, underloved dog named Borras. Cleo and her friend Adela (Nancy Garc\u00eda), the family cook, live at the end of the corridor in a tiny, cramped upstairs room. The women are from the same village in the southern state of Oaxaca and fluidly slip between Spanish and Mixtec, their native tongue, as they share gossip and sober news from home. A series of catastrophes slowly upends the stability of this world, starting with a business trip the father takes that proves calamitous. There\u2019s also an earthquake, a shattered window, an unexpected pregnancy, death and betrayal. In one of the most astonishing sequences, Cleo and the family\u2019s grandmother, Se\u00f1ora Teresa (Ver\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda), watch a student demonstration turn into a police riot through the window of a furniture showroom. Cuar\u00f3n doesn\u2019t identify the incident \u2014 known as the Corpus Christi Massacre of 1971 \u2014 but fills in that day with visceral, harrowing flashes of chaotic violence, including a piet\u00e0-like image of a woman crying for help while cradling a dying man. Cuar\u00f3n served as the director of photography for \u201cRoma,\u201d and his work here is astonishing. He shot the movie in black-and-white, large-format digital, creating images that have extraordinary clarity, detail and tonality, with entire rainbows of gray, black and white. Like Cleo, the camera is often mobile, anticipating and following her movements like a faithful companion. Cuar\u00f3n is conversant in Hollywood storytelling but here he also makes expressive use of the kind of tableau staging \u2014 arranging people in the frame \u2014 that is more familiar from art cinema. By letting a scene play out without much editing, he lets us see how each of these characters inhabits these specific spaces. Although \u201cRoma\u201d is autobiographical, Cuar\u00f3n doesn\u2019t explicitly announce it as such. The family\u2019s four children \u2014 a girl and three boys, one presumably based on the director \u2014 tend to blur into a cacophonous, charming little mob and you catch their names only in passing. The father (Fernando Grediaga) first appears onscreen in a series of cubistic close-ups \u2014 a pack of cigarettes and a lighter, two hands casually holding a car wheel \u2014 that suggest he isn\u2019t wholly present or knowable. The lumbering Ford Galaxy that he meticulously coaxes into the narrow corridor, inching forward and back, a car mirror nearly brushing a wall, suggests his isolation from a family that he soon abandons. The mother, Sof\u00eda (Marina De Tavira), is more present, though still less so than Cleo, the children\u2019s surrogate parent. Sof\u00eda is unfairly berated by her husband and she, in turn, rebukes Cleo, a chain of exploitation that Cuar\u00f3n represents coolly, occasionally letting a camera movement \u2014 a pan of the immaculate house \u2014 comment for him. \u201cRoma\u201d doesn\u2019t have a strong story; there are no inciting incidents or mysteries to solve. Instead, in scene after scene, Cuar\u00f3n creates a fine-grained vision of a woman and a world shaped by a colonialist past that inexorably weighs down the present, most conspicuously in a surreal interlude filled with guns, servants and a conflagration. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s authorial voice becomes progressively more conspicuous through his visual choices, his staging and camerawork. Much happens, but in fragments that slide together as the family and larger sociopolitical forces come into focus. In an early meal scene, one of the boys casually mentions seeing a soldier fatally shoot a kid who was throwing water balloons at an army jeep. He begins speaking over a close-up of Cleo\u2019s hands as she prepares a plate of food, an image that makes the brutality feel quotidian. In another scene, Cuar\u00f3n punctuates a shot of the parents and children watching TV with one of Cleo seated next to them on the floor, a child\u2019s arm draped on her body. Cuar\u00f3n wrote as well as edited \u201cRoma\u201d; he folds just enough exposition into ordinary-sounding conversations to keep you tethered and doesn\u2019t step on the story by overcutting it. You don\u2019t necessarily know who the children in lederhosen are in one sequence, but their outfits, casual wealth and taxidermy menagerie could fill volumes. Mostly, he speaks through his visuals, particularly the camerawork that alternately articulates his and Cleo\u2019s points of view. You see what she sees and also view her from a distance, but at times \u2014 as in a scene in which she wades into violently crashing waves, the camera steadily moving parallel with her \u2014 the movie seems to embody her being. This is a stunning sequence that\u2019s viscerally terrifying and emotionally overwhelming. Yet it also invokes the oceanic feeling of a being at one with the universe that dovetails with a climactic family road trip. You feel both Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s presence and Cleo\u2019s in this vision of her determinedly pushing against the threatening waves, an image he has dredged from the past and made alive through memory. \u201cRoma\u201d is dedicated to Liboria Rodr\u00edguez (\u201cfor Libo\u201d), the woman who raised him in a house like the one in this movie, where every so often you can see a jet passing overhead, a vision that points to a distant, peripatetic future, even as it suggests that Cuar\u00f3n never left this place, its women and its love.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/movies/roma-review.html", "date": "2018-11-20 00:00:00", "author": "By Manohla Dargis", "description": "Cuar\u00f3n uses both intimacy and monumentality to express the depths of ordinary life in this autobiographical movie set in Mexico City in the 1970s.", "title": "\u2018Roma\u2019 Review: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Masterpiece of Memory"},
{"content": "A former operations chief in the Sinaloa drug cartel testified on Tuesday that he had personally bribed one of Mexico\u2019s top law-enforcement officials, meeting with him twice in a restaurant, each time delivering a briefcase stuffed with at least $3 million in cash. The bribes were allegedly paid to Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna, an architect of the militarized crackdown on drug cartels that led to thousands of deaths under former president Felipe Calder\u00f3n. The testimony suggesting that cartel bagmen had access to the highest levels of Mexico\u2019s criminal-justice system came from Jesus Zambada Garcia, who has spent four days spilling the cartel\u2019s secrets as a witness in the federal government\u2019s case against Joaquin Guzman Loera, the drug lord known as El Chapo. In 2005, when Mr. Zambada said the first payoff occurred, Mr. Garc\u00eda Luna was in charge of the Federal Investigation Agency, Mexico\u2019s federal police force equivalent of the F.B.I. The following year, when he was accused of taking a second bribe, Mr. Garc\u00eda Luna had been appointed the country\u2019s secretary for public security. Mr. Garc\u00eda Luna could not be reached for comment. El Universal, a Mexican newspaper, reported that he denied the allegations in a written statement. Besides testifying about cash payments to Mr. Garc\u00eda Luna, Mr. Zambada told the jury about another multimillion bribe he paid in 2005. That one, he said, went to a top security official who had worked under Mexico\u2019s president-elect, Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lop\u00e9z Obrador, when Mr. Lop\u00e9z Obrador was the mayor of Mexico City. Mr. Guzman\u2019s lawyers elicited the testimony about the bribes during cross-examination as part of their effort to persuade jurors that Mr. Guzman was the victim of a conspiracy involving high-level government officials in Mexico and American drug agents. While Mr. Zambada has figured heavily in the government\u2019s case so far, his brother, Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda, who the defense alleges ordered the bribes to be paid, has been central to the defense\u2019s strategy. Ismael Zambada, known as Mayo, was Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s longtime partner in the Sinaloa cartel. The defense contends that it was Mr. Zambada who controlled the cartel and that he had for years framed Mr. Guzm\u00e1n with the help American drug agents and corrupt Mexican politicians, among them, two of the country\u2019s presidents. In court on Tuesday, a defense lawyer tried to get Mr. Zambada to provide more information about the ties between Mr. Lop\u00e9z Obrador and the security official. Federal prosecutors immediately objected, and Judge Brian M. Cogan shut down that line of questioning. All of this took place as the courtroom audience was waiting for Mr. Zambada to testify about paying off a Mexican president. That expectation had been created last week after reporters saw a transcript of a sidebar Judge Cogan held with prosecutors and defense lawyers. At the sidebar, the defense revealed a potential bombshell: that Mr. Zambada had previously told the authorities that he had paid \u201cthe now incumbent president of Mexico\u201d at least $6 million in bribes. The defense asked for permission to bring that information out in open court. But hours before Mr. Zambada appeared for his final day of testimony, the government filed a motion under seal \u201cto preclude cross-examination.\u201d The secret motion prompted another lengthy discussion out of the jury\u2019s hearing on Tuesday afternoon, the transcript of which was also sealed. It was only after that sidebar discussion ended that Judge Cogan shed a little light on what was going on in private. Ruling from the bench, he announced he was going to limit the questions that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers could ask Mr. Zambada. He said the value of the information that might be learned from a broader cross-examination did not outweigh, as he put it, \u201cprotecting individuals and entities who are not parties to this case and who would face embarrassment.\u201d Who those people and entities were remained unclear. But when Mr. Zambada took the stand again to finish his testimony, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers were only allowed to ask vague questions about bribes to presidents. William Purpura, one of the Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers, asked Mr. Zambada, for example, if he would \u201ccorrupt the president of Mexico\u201d if he could. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d Mr. Zambada responded. The government is expected to introduce 15 more cooperating witnesses who, like Mr. Zambada, will offer an inside view of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n and the cartel\u2019s operations. The defense, meanwhile, is likely to continue to argue that Ismael Zambada is the true mastermind of the organization and to press those witnesses about the extent of corruption in Mexico\u2019s government. But Judge Cogan has made it clear he will put limits on how far that questioning can go.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/nyregion/el-chapo-jury-hears-about-bribes-to-mexicos-public-security-secretary.html", "date": "2018-11-20 00:00:00", "author": "By Alan Feuer", "description": "The defense expected to elicit testimony from a cartel operative that a Mexican president had been bribed.

{"content": "More than 1,000 assorted pieces of plastic, including 115 cups, 25 bags, four bottles and two flip-flops, have been found inside a dead sperm whale in Indonesia, according to local officials. The whale, found washed ashore Monday in Wakatobi National Park, was already decomposing when rescuers arrived, so investigators were unable to determine if the plastic caused its death, said Lukas Adhyakso, the conservation director of the World Wildlife Fund in Indonesia. The plastic weighed about six kilograms, or 13 pounds, he said. But images of the dead whale resonated in Indonesia, a country that has started to reckon with its outsize use of plastics. Indonesia, a nation of about 260 million people spread over thousands of islands in Southeast Asia, was the world\u2019s second-biggest producer of plastic waste in 2015, behind only China, according to a study in the journal Science. Ingesting plastic can give whales a false sense of satiation, leading them to eat less food that provides the nutrients they need, said Nicholas Mallos, director of the Trash Free Seas program at Ocean Conservancy, an environmental nonprofit. Consumption of plastics can lead to reduced weight, energy and swimming speed, making whales more vulnerable to predators. More than 800 species of marine animals are susceptible to the estimated 8.8 million tons of plastics deposited each year in the ocean, Mr. Mallos said, and often in ways that do not lead to graphic imagery like the whale in Indonesia. Plastics can entangle and trap animals, sometimes causing them to drown, or pierce elements of their digestive systems after being swallowed. \u201cWhat is concerning is that the likelihood of these types of interactions, and these types of horrific encounters between marine organisms and plastic debris, is only likely to continue unless some drastic measures are taken,\u201d Mr. Mallos said. In 2010, the top six plastic waste producers were in or near Southeast Asia: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Much of the waste comes in the form of single-use items that do not decompose like bags, food packaging, straws and cutlery. The European Parliament voted to ban such items in October, with the ban taking effect in 2021. While Indonesia outpaces much of the world in plastic use, there are efforts underway to curb it. The country has set a goal of reducing plastic waste by 70 percent by 2025, setting aside $1 billion per year to combat the problem. In one effort to increase recycling, residents of Surabaya, the country\u2019s second-largest city, can pay their bus fare by recycling 10 plastic cups or up to five plastic bottles. A patchwork of laws in United States cities has encouraged consumers to give up disposable items like plastic straws and bags, and some companies have pledged to limit their availability. But disposable plastics remain a staggering worldwide challenge.  In June, a dead whale found in Thailand had nearly 18 pounds of plastics in its stomach. A whale in Spain was discovered to have 64 pounds of trash clogging its intestines and stomach. Mr. Adhyakso said the solution required \u201cthe entire world to start thinking about it.\u201d \u201cWe will start doing our part, but all the regions should do the same,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/world/asia/whale-plastics-indonesia.html", "date": "2018-11-21 00:00:00", "author": "By Daniel Victor", "description": "Cups, bags, bottles and even two flip-flops were found inside a sperm whale that had washed ashore in Indonesia, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of plastic waste.", "title": "1,000 Pieces of Plastic Found Inside Dead Whale in Indonesia"},
{"content": "ATLANTA \u2014 In an often-biting opinion, a federal judge on Tuesday blocked a Mississippi law that sought to forbid most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Judge Carlton W. Reeves of Federal District Court in Jackson, the Mississippi capital, wrote that the law \u201cdisregards\u201d the 14th Amendment\u2019s promise of due process and defied the United States Supreme Court\u2019s existing precedents on abortion rights. \u201cThe state chose to pass a law it knew was unconstitutional to endorse a decades-long campaign, fueled by national interest groups, to ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThis court follows the commands of the Supreme Court and the dictates of the United States Constitution, rather than the disingenuous calculations of the Mississippi Legislature.\u201d He added, in a footnote, that the Legislature\u2019s \u201cprofessed interest in \u2018women\u2019s health\u2019 is pure gaslighting\u201d and that Mississippi officials challenge abortion rights but \u201cchoose not to lift a finger to address the tragedies lurking on the other side of the delivery room: our alarming infant and maternal mortality rates.\u201d Judge Reeves, who cited evidence that viability begins at between 23 and 24 weeks, issued his decision about eight months after the Republican-dominated Mississippi state government enacted the law, which banned abortions if \u201cthe probable gestational age of the unborn human\u201d was determined to be more than 15 weeks. The statute included narrow exceptions for medical emergencies or \u201ca severe fetal abnormality.\u201d The law drew a same-day court challenge by the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the state\u2019s only provider of abortion services, and Judge Reeves responded almost as quickly with an order that barred the law from being enforced. It was not until Tuesday, though, that he issued a permanent injunction and described the law as \u201ca facially unconstitutional ban on abortions prior to viability.\u201d But Judge Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, said the law may have been the foundation of a \u201cdeliberate effort\u201d by Mississippi politicians to overturn Roe v. Wade, which recognized a nationwide right to an abortion. \u201cWith the recent changes in the membership of the Supreme Court, it may be that the state believes divine providence covered the Capitol when it passed this legislation,\u201d Judge Reeves wrote. \u201cTime will tell. If overturning Roe is the state\u2019s desired result, the state will have to seek that relief from a higher court. For now, the United States Supreme Court has spoken.\u201d The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, among the nation\u2019s most conservative appellate benches, would consider an appeal by the state. The Mississippi attorney general\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement on Wednesday, a spokesman for Gov. Phil Bryant said the governor was \u201cdisappointed in Tuesday\u2019s ruling against a law that protects both mother and child.\u201d \u201cHe fully supports the defense of this law moving forward,\u201d the spokesman, Knox Graham, said in an email. Critics of the law regarded Judge Reeves\u2019s decision as a warning to other states that might consider similar legislation. \u201cToday\u2019s decision should be a wake-up call for state lawmakers who are continuously trying to chip away at abortion access,\u201d said Nancy Northup, the president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which was involved in the Mississippi litigation. \u201cSuch bans will not stand in a court of law.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/us/mississippi-abortion-law.html", "date": "2018-11-20 00:00:00", "author": "By Alan Blinder", "description": "The judicial ruling said Mississippi\u2019s law amounted to \u201ca facially unconstitutional ban on abortions prior to viability.\u201d The decision could lead to more legal wrangling.", "title": "Judge Blocks Mississippi Law Banning Abortions After 15 Weeks"},
{"content": "Art sales are climbing worldwide, according to a report on the art market, rising to $63.7 billion in 2017. Which raises the question: Where are people putting all that art? \u201cDealers have to store it, then they sell it to collectors who have to store it, then they donate it to museums that have to store it,\u201d said Todd Levin, an art adviser in New York. As a result, storage companies are scrambling to keep up with the growth by expanding their facilities and offering more services to meet demand as collectors and galleries run out of room. The global art report, from the international art fair Art Basel and the Swiss investment bank UBS, showed that sales were 12 percent higher last year than in 2016. The United States was the largest market, with 42 percent of sales by value. That\u2019s good news for Uovo, which provides concierge storage services in New York for art, fashion and other collections. In the three years that Uovo has been in business, it has expanded from one 280,000-square-foot site in Long Island City, Queens, to two more in Rockland County for a total of 520,000 square feet. A fourth facility, being built in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, will add 150,000 square feet. Crozier Fine Arts, a New York competitor, has also grown, from 280,000 square feet in 2009 to 1.2 million, and is likely to reach two million within five years, according to the company\u2019s president, Simon Hornby. The growth in art storage can be attributed not only to the expanding art market but also to the increasing size of contemporary works of art, some of which may be multimedia installations filling auditorium-size rooms. Contemporary art makes up 75 percent of the objects stored at Crozier and half of the items warehoused at Uovo. One 50-foot-tall contemporary sculpture at Delaware Freeport, an art storage site and foreign trade zone in Newark, Del., had numerous parts and took up 5,000 square feet, according to Fritz Dietl, the company\u2019s founder and president. Before the work was recently put on tour in Europe, it had been in storage for two years. \u201cBigger art galleries have become Jurassic-sized,\u201d said Mr. Levin, who added that all of his clients had some percentage of their collections in storage. \u201cThey are working with artists who are working on a larger scale, which I call the art fair dynamic.\u201d Art that goes into storage generally stays there for a while. In some cases, the sale of a work of art simply means that a crate moves across the hall from one storage bin to another, or from one storage facility to another. \u201cThat\u2019s happened with me,\u201d said Steven Guttman, the founder and chairman of Uovo, who is also a noted collector of contemporary art. A client mentions something that Mr. Guttman likes, \u201cand I buy it from him and put it in my room.\u201d Some artworks at the Geneva Freeport in Switzerland, a combination foreign trade zone and fine art storage facility, \u201chave transacted four or five times without ever leaving the building,\u201d said Evan Beard, who heads the art services group at U.S. Trust. Art handlers are allowed to open a crate and put it in a viewing room at the site for an interested buyer. But the contents of the crates are unknown to the operators and staff of the storage facilities; they have no lists of which artworks are there, how much they are worth, or whether they are authentic or fakes or stolen. \u201cI have a sneaking suspicion that in some of these storage units, one would find a number of stolen and looted objects,\u201d said Robert K. Wittman, a former F.B.I. investigator of stolen artworks who now works privately as an art security consultant. All of the objects stored at these facilities are insured by their owners, and insurance companies \u201care not required to report to the F.B.I. or to Interpol\u201d if a policyholder is insuring a stolen object, Mr. Wittman said. \u201cThey have no law enforcement purview,\u201d he added. But insurers do have a say in how many pieces of art are stored in one site, a factor in the growth in the number of art storage facilities. \u201cAn insurance company may find itself out of capacity at a particular storage site where there is several billion dollars in insured art at the location,\u201d said Steven Pincus, who leads the national fine art practice at DeWitt Stern, an insurance brokerage firm based in Manhattan. In those situations, the insurer may tell the policyholder to place some artworks at another site \u201cto solve the aggregation problem by spreading the risk to different locations,\u201d he said. Short- and long-term art storage solves a variety of problems. Collectors who are having their homes remodeled or who are buying artworks for a home yet to be built may store objects while awaiting completion. Or they may just rotate works on display in their homes with items in storage. People who live in a home only part of the year may store art from the house when it\u2019s vacant for safekeeping. Those living in areas that have a high probability of natural disasters may put their valuables in storage during the seasons when those events are most prevalent. \u201cAs collectors get older and start to downsize, storage is an obvious solution,\u201d said Sique Spence, director of Nancy Hoffman Gallery in New York. Thomas Burns, chief operations officer of the Fortress, an art storage company with facilities in Boston, Miami and New York, said more foreign nationals were becoming clients. Some of them, he added, may be parking \u201cmovable assets, such as art, in U.S. storage facilities\u201d when there is political or economic instability in their home countries. Accidents happen, but not that often. A fire at Momart\u2019s east London warehouse in 2004 destroyed hundreds of works by such noted artists as Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst and Chris Ofili. A fire at Artex\u2019s warehouse in Dedham, Mass., in 2005 destroyed and damaged many pieces. In 2004, Fine Art Logistics, a storage company in London, mistakenly left out for trash a 1984 sculpture by Anish Kapoor. Crozier has \u201ca rigorous art handler training program and best-in-class operating systems, which directly contribute to a very low number of cases where clients\u2019 property is adversely affected while being handled,\u201d Milena Sales, a spokeswoman for the company, said. But in the end, storage provides an easy solution to a modern problem: what to do with all the high-priced stuff collectors have been accumulating. Art collecting, which suggests a personal vision of art expressed in a stockpiling of works that reflect certain themes or interests, has morphed into art investing, which keeps pieces tucked away, in crates, until they have appreciated in value and then may be displayed and sold. \u201cSophisticated buyers get no pleasure from something in a crate in a facility,\u201d said Thomas C. Danziger, an art lawyer in New York. Still, he added, \u201cno one buys a seven-figure work of art just for pleasure.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/business/art-storage.html", "date": "2018-11-13 00:00:00", "author": "By Daniel Grant", "description": "Storage companies are scrambling to keep up growing demand by expanding their facilities and offering more services as collectors and galleries run out of room.", "title": "As Art Collections Grow, So Do the Places That Stash Them"},

{"content": "A central goal of visual journalism is to reduce the distance between the information we journalists gather and the understanding we can convey to readers. And as technologies evolve, the kit of tools and applications we can use to deliver the news to readers is always expanding.  Augmented reality is one such technology, enabled by our mobile platforms, that lets us create experiences that reduce that distance. With A.R., your phone can become a window, through which the physical environment around you is augmented with digital information. This can be anything from contextual information relevant to where you stand, to an object that appears as if it were there in the space with you. It allows you to interact with this virtual object in the same manner as you would the physical environment it has been augmented into. You may have seen our previous augmented reality projects, including an in-depth look at David Bowie\u2019s visual legacy through the \u201cDavid Bowie Is\u201d exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum. We brought life-size art objects to our readers, allowing them to walk around Mr. Bowie\u2019s iconic fashion pieces and examine them up close. Or a project aimed to shed light on the nail-biting rescue of a Thai boys\u2019 soccer team from deep inside a cave, in which we used the technology to project accurate slices of the cave at key junctures to give a better sense of what rescue divers had to contend with. An augmented reality feature we published this month with the Metropolitan section, titled \u201cTake a Tour of Lady Liberty\u2019s Torch (Right This Second),\u201d demonstrates what is now possible. The article provides a history of the original torch, which has been on display in the statue\u2019s pedestal since it was replaced in the 1980s. Surely if we could deliver every reader to the inside of the pedestal to view the torch firsthand, that would be the best way to convey its shape, its size, its details and perhaps its grandeur. Augmented reality allows us to deliver the next best thing \u2014 we can give readers the experience of placing a photographic, three-dimensional capture of the torch into their immediate environment, in life size, and then to walk around it, up to it, even on it. Capturing the torch in this way took the special expertise of our newsroom staff, and a bit of a balancing act. \u201cWe left Lower Manhattan at dawn, taking the 6:30 a.m. ferry from Battery Park with all the employees who work on the island,\u201d explained Niko Koppel, a producer on the immersive storytelling team. He was joined by the graphics editor Mika Gr\u00f6ndahl. Neither of them had ever been to Liberty Island before. \u201cThis was truly an amazing way to see it, crossing New York harbor to the illuminated statue at sunrise,\u201d he said. When Niko and Mika arrived at the pedestal of the statue, they were overwhelmed: It was a dark, cavernous space, and the torch is 16 and a half feet tall, almost reaching the ceiling. They used 13 LED lights to illuminate the torch from all sides, and then began shooting, first with wide shots of the torch, lit and unlit, from the balcony. In a little over an hour of shooting, Niko and Mika took more than 900 photos of the torch, 675 of which were used to create the three-dimensional reconstruction readers can view in the article. Some physical maneuvering was necessary to get many of the angles: Shooting the underside of the torch\u2019s balcony involved \u201cscooching around on the ground,\u201d Niko said. \u201cIn order to shoot the floor of the balcony and close-up details of the glass flame, I had to balance on the second-tallest rung of a 10-foot ladder,\u201d he added. \u201cMika spotted the ladder as I did my best to work quickly, maintain my balance and not crash through the historic treasure.\u201d Plans had been in the works for the Metropolitan section to produce this story for some time, timed to coincide with the torch\u2019s coming move to a more permanent home in a new museum nearby. Jeffrey Furticella, a photo editor for the Metro desk, initially suggested the inclusion of an augmented reality component, noting that it seemed like a good opportunity to use the technology since it was a story so focused on one particular object. \u201cWe thought it would be good to give our readers a bit of history on the torch, while allowing them to experience what the old torch looks like,\u201d explained Meghan Louttit, an editor and designer on the project. \u201cThat\u2019s where the historical photos in the piece come in, which are a nice complement to the A.R. component. Both communicate scale, while the photos show what a complex process it was to move it the first time.\u201d \u201cThis piece is especially great for readers who might never have the opportunity to visit the statue,\u201d she suggested. \u201cAlthough, I have to admit, even having been there, it was still really cool to see it again up close.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/reader-center/statue-liberty-torch-augmented-reality.html", "date": "2018-11-19 00:00:00", "author": "By Graham Roberts", "description": "For a new A.R. project, we combined 675 photos of the original torch of the Statue of Liberty to allow readers to see it up close as never before.", "title": "Capturing an American Icon for Augmented Reality"},
{"content": "\u201cIt\u2019s all in the wrist,\u201d said Johnnie Wicklin, mimicking a pizza toss. For 35 years, Mr. Wicklin threw a couple of hundred pies a day at various pizza shops across the city, spending many of those years at Ray\u2019s Pizza locations. Starting as a teenager, he worked his way up from delivering pizzas to making them, perfecting his technique. But it\u2019s been more than five years since he made a pie or served a slice. Three heart attacks, one stroke and a condition known as frozen shoulder in both arms forced him to give up working. He is still suffering from heart disease. At the same time, his marriage broke up and he found himself homeless. \u201cI lost everything,\u201d Mr. Wicklin, 59, said in an interview last month. In frail health, he moved from shelter to shelter, afraid of getting sick when sharing a room with up to 20 men. Those staying in shelters are normally required to leave the facilities during the day; Mr. Wicklin had to receive special passes to spend more time resting, to recover from his medical issues. Once he got better, Mr. Wicklin said, he spent many of his days in nearby parks. \u201cI couldn\u2019t travel far, because I was concerned with my well-being,\u201d he said. \u201cThe park was always a big thing. In any area I was in, I would always look for a park. That\u2019s the most sacred thing you can look for \u2014 you can\u2019t sit anywhere else. Nobody wants to see you.\u201d In July, Mr. Wicklin finally received his own apartment through Section 8 housing on the Upper East Side. It came unfurnished, and Mr. Wicklin slept on the floor with a blanket at first. Slowly but surely, he began to build a home for himself. He made friends with a porter in the neighborhood, who would alert him on garbage collection days if anything good was in the trash: a table, some chairs, a fan, a headboard. Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, used $495 from the fund to buy Mr. Wicklin a royal blue sleeper sofa. Recently, he saved enough for his own twin bed. \u201cIt\u2019s doing it for me, you know?\u201d he said. He has already made friends with the employees at the Ray\u2019s Pizza down the block from his apartment, and he stops by every few weeks. But it is his daily visit to the Fort Tryon Adult Day Care that keeps him sane, he said. A van picks Mr. Wicklin up every morning and drops him back off in the afternoon. He plays bingo, practices tai chi and goes to the movies twice a month. He also receives physical therapy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take it day by day. That\u2019s what scares me,\u201d Mr. Wicklin said. \u201cI know one day I\u2019m going to drop dead. I have to worry about getting money just to bury myself, just so I could be cremated.\u201d He receives $837 a month in Social Security benefits, and $192 a month in food stamps. Getting out of the shelter system \u201cfeels great,\u201d Mr. Wicklin said, letting out a big sigh. \u201cYou get to do whatever you want, whenever you please. It took a long time to do what I want.\u201d He is estranged from his family, he said, and misses working. But his poor health prevents him from finding a job. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working, it\u2019s great,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the power, my heart.\u201d The community center serves Mr. Wicklin breakfast and lunch; he brings leftovers home for dinner. In addition to watching his wallet, he also has to watch what he eats; Mr. Wicklin keeps a simple diet for his heart. \u201cI try really hard to scrape, but I\u2019m getting by,\u201d he said. He used to eat two to three slices of pizza every day. Now he steers clear of it. \u201cIt\u2019s really addictive,\u201d he said. \u201cYou ever try that pizza?\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/neediest-cases/pizza-maker-homeless.html", "date": "2018-11-20 00:00:00", "author": "By Remy Tumin", "description": "After decades of tossing pies, Johnnie Wicklin spent five years living in homeless shelters, recovering from heart attacks and a stroke.", "title": "Hobbled by Health Problems, a Pizza Man Hangs Up His Apron"},

{"content": "LONDON \u2014 Hard-liners in Britain\u2019s governing Conservative Party have so dominated debate over withdrawal from the European Union for the past two years that when they called last week for the overthrow of Prime Minister Theresa May, failure did not occur to them as a possibility. But on Tuesday the so-called coup against Mrs. May was halted \u2014 for now, anyway \u2014 after the plotters admitted having been misled by their own supporters, who had melted away. The setback for the hard-liners is some rare good news for Mrs. May, who is fighting for her political life, battling to quell a rebellion within her party and her cabinet over draft plans for a withdrawal, or Brexit, that would maintain some close ties to the European Union. Those who want a no-confidence vote in Mrs. May need letters of support from 48 Conservative lawmakers, and their struggle to assemble that number has been portrayed as symptomatic of the incompetence of many hard-line Brexiteer proponents, including those in government, several of whom have quit the cabinet. \u201cTheir record is an uninterrupted litany of cowardice, incompetence and blame shifting,\u201d Robert Shrimsley wrote in a column for the Financial Times. \u201cFor all the bluster, they have blinked, bottled or botched it at every turn.\u201d Yet Mrs. May is far from safe. The Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland, whose 10 lawmakers prop up the government, on Monday refused to support it in parliamentary votes, a calculated message to the prime minister. And while her Conservative critics may have retreated in some embarrassment, they still hope to oust her next month, if not in the coming days. The move against Mrs. May began last week: While she was speaking to television cameras outside Parliament, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of a group of pro-Brexit lawmakers, demanded the no-confidence vote, and newspapers confidently predicted that the 48 letters would be submitted by Monday. Surrounded again by television crews on Tuesday, but with no sign that the total had been reached, the tone was more defensive. Mr. Rees-Mogg batted away suggestions that he had been humiliated. \u201cPatience is a virtue, virtue is a grace, etc.,\u201d said Mr. Rees-Mogg, who quoted a British nursery rhyme to reporters. \u201cWe shall see whether letters come in due time.\u201d To her hard-line enemies, Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit blueprint is a betrayal of a 2016 referendum decision to quit the bloc. They want a cleaner break with continental Europe\u2019s economic structures so that Britain is free to make its own trade deals. Under the draft agreement, that might not be possible for several years, if ever. Provided that they are approved by European leaders on Sunday, Mrs. May\u2019s plans will face their ultimate test in a vote in Parliament, probably early next month, and the arithmetic currently looks difficult for her. Mr. Rees-Mogg said that some in the pro-Brexit faction calculated that they had a better prospect of toppling her after Parliament has considered \u2014 and they hope rejected \u2014 her Brexit deal in what is being called the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on it. \u201cDo 47 want to come with me or not? I may find that they don\u2019t, or that they don\u2019t do it today but they do it when we get the meaningful vote,\u201d Mr. Rees-Mogg said, adding that because of the leadership election rules, more would join later, or risk keeping Mrs. May as their long-term leader. Now is the time to move against Mrs. May, he said, \u201cor the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election.\u201d A few feet away Steve Baker, another lawmaker and the group\u2019s unofficial head-counter, sounded a little more chastened, noting that he had received pledges from enough colleagues to trigger the vote, but that not all had followed through by sending in their letters. So far, at least 26 have declared in public that they want a confidence vote, and more are thought to have sent letters privately. Among those urging them to hold back is William Hague, a former Conservative Party leader, who, in the Daily Telegraph, described the political crisis engulfing the country as the gravest he had seen. If it changed prime ministers, he warned, Britain could end up being \u201cthe laughingstock of the world.\u201d Mrs. May seems to have seen off the imminent threat of more cabinet resignations, following two last week \u2014 though, again, there is no guarantee that the truce is anything more than temporary. But if she is to win her big Brexit vote, she probably needs to mend fences with the Democratic Unionist Party and calm the mood among Conservative lawmakers, many of whom could still support a move to oust her. No-confidence letters are sent in private to Graham Brady, the senior Conservative lawmaker who adjudicates as chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. He is the only person who knows how close the rebels are to the 48 target, and he is not saying. His only hint was to note that, on this issue, politicians are not always truthful. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for eight years,\u201d he told the BBC on Sunday, \u201cand some years ago I certainly had the experience of seeing somebody claiming publicly to have written me a letter when they hadn\u2019t, and then again seeing them in public on the media saying they\u2019d withdrawn the letter that they hadn\u2019t written in the first place.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/world/europe/uk-brexit-theresa-may.html", "date": "2018-11-20 00:00:00", "author": "By Stephen Castle", "description": "Hard-line, pro-Brexit Conservatives thought they could force a confidence vote against the prime minister.

{"content": "SKOPJE, Macedonia \u2014 A former Macedonian prime minister who fled the country while facing a prison sentence on corruption charges claimed on Tuesday that he had been granted political asylum in Hungary. The former leader, Nikola Gruevski \u2014 who ran the country as a strongman for a decade before being forced out of office in 2016 after nationwide protests \u2014 had been sentenced to two years in prison for abusing the power of his office to purchase a luxury vehicle. He also faces several more serious charges, some stemming from a vast scandal involving hundreds of thousands of secretly recorded conversations in which top government officials were heard discussing crimes like rigging votes and covering up killings. American diplomats and European officials viewed his trial and conviction as a step forward in a region plagued by corruption and ethnic divisions. Macedonia aspires to join the European Union, and his trial was widely seen as sending a clear message that even the most powerful politicians could not act with impunity. The Hungarian government, which initially took nearly two days to confirm that Mr. Gruevski was in Budapest, did not respond to requests for comment on his claim of asylum. But a pro-government newspaper, Magyar Id\u00f6k, reported that the Hungarian Immigration and Asylum Office had established that the legal conditions to grant him asylum had been met. The paper said that his case was heard on Nov. 12 by the authorities, who found there was a legitimate threat to Mr. Gruevski\u2019s life if he stayed in Macedonia, and that the local authorities could not provide the protection he required. Mr. Gruevski, in a lengthy post on Facebook, sought to portray himself as a victim. \u201cI have not fled from justice, but I have used internationally regulated methods to continue my quest for justice,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have decided not to grant their wish to see me in prison, where, from what I have learned, I was to be eliminated, while they are taking the country apart.\u201d Macedonian government officials \u2014 who were caught by surprise when Mr. Gruevski managed to flee the country and shocked that he would seek asylum in a European Union nation \u2014 were aghast at reports that his bid had been accepted. They said there was no truth to his allegations. The Macedonian government had submitted a request on Monday that Mr. Gruevski be returned to the country. In public statements, American and European diplomats said that the trial had been fair and that he should face justice in Macedonia. Renata Deskoska, Macedonia\u2019s justice minister, pointed out that asylum procedures usually take a considerable amount of time. \u201cIf he really got an asylum,\u201d she said, \u201cit must have been done quite expediently for some reason.\u201d The government said in a statement that Mr. Gruevski had been convicted in \u201ca fair and transparent procedure\u201d and that he had \u201cnever reported any threats for his life.\u201d \u201cThe only reason why he escaped is to avoid justice,\u201d it said. Mr. Gruevski\u2019s choice of Hungary was not without irony: Under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the country has instituted draconian measures to keep out refugees fleeing war and starvation. Mr. Orban also frequently says that no nation should interfere in other countries\u2019 internal affairs, noted Edit Zgut, a foreign-policy analyst in Warsaw. \u201cBut this is exactly what they have just done by giving asylum for a convicted politician,\u201d she said. While Mr. Orban has battled with Brussels on what it means to be a member of the European Union \u2014 notably around immigration policy and rule-of-law issues \u2014 his decision to grant asylum to a former political ally still came as a surprise to many. Macedonia is in the midst of one of the most trying times in its young existence as a nation. The government recently reached an agreement with Greece that would allow it to chart a course to join NATO. But to win Greek approval, it agreed to change its name, a highly divisive issue that stirs deep passions in both countries.

{"content": "On the 33rd anniversary of Joe Theismann\u2019s career-ending leg injury, Alex Smith, the veteran quarterback of the Washington Redskins, left Sunday\u2019s game against the Houston Texans with what appeared to be a devastating injury to his right ankle. [Read: Bill Pennington discusses Alex Smith\u2019s injury with Joe Theismann] Smith, who started the season 6-3 after coming over from the Kansas City Chiefs in an off-season trade, had dropped back to pass in the third quarter, when he was wrapped up by Kareem Jackson and then hit head-on by J.J. Watt. As Smith crumbled to the ground, his right foot caught on the turf, twisting awkwardly. His legs shot into the air, with his foot bent at an unnatural angle that was immediately reminiscent of the knee injury Theismann sustained on Nov. 18, 1985 as a result of a hit by Lawrence Taylor of the Giants. After the game, Redskins Coach Jay Gruden confirmed that Smith suffered a broken tibia and fibula and would undergo immediate surgery. Theismann, whose injury is among the most notorious in N.F.L. history, was in attendance at the game and immediately commented on the play on Twitter. Smith\u2019s season-ending injury is a huge blow to the Redskins, who came into the day leading the N.F.C. East. Smith, 34, has had a long and winding career since being selected by the San Francisco 49ers with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 draft. His first six seasons were a mess of forgettable play and injuries, but he had his career resurrected under Coach Jim Harbaugh, and over the last eight seasons, his record as a starter, for San Francisco and Kansas City, was 75-34-1. Despite having perhaps his best season statistically last year for the Chiefs, Smith was traded to make room for Patrick Mahomes, the young quarterback who has emerged as a likely candidate for the N.F.L.\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award. Mahomes has consistently cited his time working under Smith for giving him a smooth transition to the N.F.L., and head of Kansas City\u2019s much-anticipated matchup with the Los Angeles Rams on Monday, Smith was in Mahomes\u2019s thoughts.

{"content": "President Trump has a proclivity for tweeting, typos and trenchant nicknames. In making use of the first habit on Sunday, he alluded to a profanity \u2014 and left many wondering which of his other online idiosyncrasies were at work. In the tweet, the president took aim at Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, a Democrat who is the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Schiff has said that Democrats would investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, who is charged with overseeing the Russia investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. \u201cSo funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. The post quickly set off reactions on social media, as some critics assumed that the president had deliberately misspelled the congressman\u2019s name to make it sound like a vulgarity. \u201cThe Office of the President was made for better things than an infantile tweet misspelling a congressman\u2019s name like a curse word,\u201d tweeted Walter M. Shaub Jr., the former top ethics watchdog for the federal government who resigned last year after going head-to-head with the Trump administration. Mr. Schiff himself also fired back. \u201cWow, Mr. President, that\u2019s a good one. Was that like your answers to Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions, or did you write this one yourself?\u201d he wrote, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers drafting written answers to some of Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday evening: Was it a nickname? A typo? Both? History offers little guidance. Mr. Trump has an uncanny ability to brand rivals with unflattering nicknames, from \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d (Hillary Clinton) to \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d (Senator Ted Cruz) and \u201cPocahontas\u201d (Senator Elizabeth Warren). Using the word \u201clittle\u201d before the names of his opponents is a go-to tactic. He has even used the phrase on Mr. Schiff in the past: \u201cLittle Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington,\u201d the president tweeted this year. Inexplicably, he has also called him \u201cLiddle\u2019 Adam Schiff.\u201d But Mr. Trump is also known for typos and spelling errors in his tweets. People have caught  basic spelling errors in Mr. Trump\u2019s posts (and more in other statements by his staff), some of them small (\u201ccounsel\u201d as \u201ccouncil,\u201d \u201cgas\u201d instead of \u201chas,\u201d \u201ctapp\u201d for \u201ctap\u201d), some large (\u201cunpresidented\u201d for \u201cunprecedented,\u201d \u201chonered\u201d for \u201chonored\u201d). Perhaps most famously, Mr. Trump incited a worldwide mystery with a middle-of-the-night tweet that introduced a new word to the language: \u201ccovfefe.\u201d We still don\u2019t know what that means.

{"content": "Would this be the week that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d finally got out from underneath its own soap opera and turned its full attention to the world beyond Studio 8H? Having spent the first leg of its season accounting for its own in-house drama \u2014 Kanye West\u2019s outbursts, Alec Baldwin\u2019s arrest and Pete Davidson\u2019s various self-immolations and apologies \u2014 could \u201cS.N.L.\u201d now find a narrative in which the show itself was not at its center? In the absence of a central premise for its cold open or a Baldwin-size impersonation to hang it on, \u201cS.N.L.\u201d returned to its recurring parody of Fox News\u2019s \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d as a clearinghouse for various celebrity impressions and riffs on recent news events. The segment opened on Kate McKinnon (as the host Laura Ingraham) lamenting that \u201ccelebrities in California are whining about some tiny wildfires while our heroic president is under constant attack from rain.\u201d McKinnon then turned to what she called \u201cthe rampant voter fraud that allowed Democrats to literally steal the election.\u201d \u201cSome have claimed that suburban women revolted against the Republican Party, but doesn\u2019t it feel more true that all Hispanics voted twice?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss that idea simply because it isn\u2019t true and sounds insane.\u201d (McKinnon added that preposterous premise to her list of \u201cFeel Facts,\u201d which also included entries like \u201cLatinos Can Have a Baby Every Three Months,\u201d \u201cSanta Is Jesus\u2019s Dad\u201d and \u201cIf the Earth Is So Warm, Then Why Are My Feet Cold?\u201d) The sketch also featured Cecily Strong as Jeanine Pirro, a fellow Fox News host, who warned, \u201cIn Georgia, many people were wearing disguises in order to vote multiple times.\u201d Indicating a photograph of Tyler Perry, Strong said, \u201cI saw this man vote in Atlanta. Then he went into his car and changed into this woman.\u201d (Here the photograph changed to a picture of Perry in drag as his Madea character.) \u201cAnd he was threatening white voters with a gun and yelling, \u2018Hellur.\u2019\u201d Strong warned of such dubious tactics as \u201cstacking\u201d \u2014 when \u201cmultiple children will stack on top of each other under a trench coat and then vote as an adult\u201d \u2014 and \u201cKlumping,\u201d or when \u201ca single man poses as a family of five.\u201d (Here the screen displayed a poster for Eddie Murphy\u2019s remake of \u201cThe Nutty Professor.\u201d) On the sketch went, with appearances from the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg (Alex Moffat), defending his company from criticism about its handling of Russian interference and hate speech on the site (\u201cI can\u2019t be any more transparent. Have you seen my skin?\u201d); and Representative Marcia Fudge of Ohio (Leslie Jones) who has said she may run against Representative Nancy Pelosi as House speaker. \u201cNancy Pelosi is tainted,\u201d she said. \u201cFor years, the GOP has used her name against us. But Republicans can never find a way to make fun of me, a middle-aged black woman named Fudge.\u201d In other memorable moments from the show: Returning to host the show for the first time in a decade, Steve Carell did not get far into his monologue before he was asked (by \u201cS.N.L.\u201d ringers) if he would consider appearing in a reboot of his NBC sitcom \u201cThe Office.\u201d \u201cIt was a great experience,\u201d Carell responded. \u201cI love all those people. But I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best idea. I think maybe we should just leave it alone.\u201d He then had to address questions and comments from other former \u201cOffice\u201d cast members who\u2019d been planted in the audience. Ellie Kemper told him, \u201cPeople would really love to see an \u2018Office\u2019 reboot. \u2018Cause I need that money. Let\u2019s get that money, Steve.\u201d Ed Helms said, \u201cYeah, so, I just don\u2019t think you understand how much money we\u2019re talking about.

Why are you getting hung up on the details?\u201d Even Carell\u2019s wife, Nancy, who was seated in the studio next to their children, urged him to consider the proposition. \u201cWe think you should probably do the show,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really need you to hang around anymore.\u201d In a filmed segment, Carell played the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who recently announced that the company would establish new headquarters in Long Island City and in Arlington, Va. \u201cAnd everyone, except for the people who live there, and who live in all the places we didn\u2019t choose, is thrilled,\u201d Carell said. He added, Carell went on to announce other corporate decisions \u2014 some real, some satirical \u2014 that seemed perfectly calibrated to get under President Trump\u2019s skin: establishing a \u201csatellite office in Palm Beach, across the street from Mar-a-Lago\u201d; the purchasing of The Washington Post; and a brand-new delivery option called Amazon Caravan, which Carell explained to mean, \u201cAny package going to any Trump building will get delivered by hundreds of Honduran and Mexican immigrants.\u201d Pete Davidson and Chris Redd paid a hip-hop tribute to the endurance of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was recently hospitalized with three broken ribs after falling in her office. McKinnon, who usually plays Ginsburg on \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d appeared in the video but had little to say. Most of the heavy lifting was done by Davidson and Redd, who traded rhymes like: \u201cSupreme Court\u2019s a boys\u2019 club, she holds it down, no cares given / Who else got six movies about her and still living?\u201d The video ended with Redd asking Davidson, \u201cYo, tell \u2018em your favorite RBG decision, dawg.\u201d Davidson awkwardly replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d From the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on Amazon\u2019s announcement of its new headquarters and the recounts in Florida\u2019s midterm elections. Jost: Che: Highlighting what he said was \u201cone of the stranger stories to emerge from the midterm elections,\u201d Che introduced Representative-Elect Denver Riggleman, Republican of Virginia (played by Mikey Day), who is also the author of a book called \u201cMating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women Want Him.\u201d Facing accusations that he is \u201ca devotee of Bigfoot erotica,\u201d Day explained, \u201cI\u2019m not into that stuff.\u201d He added, \u201cPorn is a cheap thrill, Michael.

{"content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Interpol gathered police chiefs from around the world in Dubai on Sunday to select a new president, months after the global crime-fighting agency\u2019s former leader was abruptly arrested by China on corruption charges. The agency is holding its first general assembly since its president, Meng Hongwei, who was also China\u2019s vice minister of public security, went missing in September while on a trip to China. After Interpol officials demanded answers from Beijing, and after Mr. Meng\u2019s wife, Grace Meng, revealed he had sent her an emoji of a knife to signify danger, it emerged that Mr. Meng, a Chinese citizen, had been secretly detained. The arrest of an official with decades of experience in Beijing\u2019s security apparatus, who was at the head of an international organization, was a bold move even by the standards of the increasingly authoritarian system under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. China eventually said Mr. Meng was being investigated on charges of taking bribes and other crimes, as part of a sweeping anticorruption campaign under President Xi Jinping. Ms. Meng told The Associated Press from France, where she lives and where Interpol has its headquarters, that the bribery accusation was an excuse for a lengthy detention and that her husband was being persecuted for political reasons. In Dubai on Sunday, the acting Interpol president, Kim Jong-yang of South Korea, helped open the ceremony for the general assembly meeting, which runs until Wednesday, when the vote on the next president was to take place. A report from The Sunday Times in London said that British officials expected Alexander Prokopchuk, 56, a veteran of Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry, to become the next Interpol president. It could not be independently confirmed by The New York Times. As more than 1,000 delegates from 192 member states began filling the main hall, the Interpol secretary general, Jurgen Stock, explained to reporters that the agency\u2019s rules did not allow for Mr. Meng to continue acting as president. Mr. Meng began serving as president in November 2016, and his term was due to end in 2020. Mr. Stock said that Interpol received Mr. Meng\u2019s resignation letter from China on Oct. 7 and that the Chinese authorities had notified Interpol that Mr. Meng was no longer a delegate to the agency. \u201cIt sounds a little technical, but again that automatically leads to the fact, according to our rules, that he is not the president anymore,\u201d Mr. Stock said. \u201cWe had to take the measures to ensure the functioning of the organization.\u201d Mr. Meng\u2019s representatives say that Interpol accepted an unsigned resignation letter without any resistance and without evidence of his consent. Just over a week ago, Mr. Stock told reporters in France that there was no reason for him to suspect that anything about Mr. Meng\u2019s resignation \u201cwas forced or wrong.\u201d He said that he had \u201cencouraged\u201d the Chinese authorities to provide information about Mr. Meng\u2019s location and legal status but that he could do no more because Interpol\u2019s role is \u201cnot to govern over member states.\u201d In addition to selecting a new president, Interpol member states are to decide whether to accept Kosovo as a full member, which would allow officials there to file \u201cred notices\u201d for Serbian officials that Kosovo considers war criminals. The red notices are alerts circulated to all member countries that identify a person wanted for arrest by another country. Interpol says there are 57,289 active red notices around the world. Interpol acts as a clearinghouse for national police services that want to find suspects outside their borders. The body, however, has faced criticism that governments from countries like Russia have abused the red notice system to go after political enemies and dissidents, even though its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality and prohibits the use of police notices for political reasons. Two years ago, Interpol introduced new measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts checks a notice\u2019s compliance with Interpol rules before it goes out. Interpol also introduced an appeals body for those targeted with red notices.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/world/asia/interpol-president-china.html", "date": "2018-11-18 00:00:00", "author": "By The Associated Press", "description": "The agency is holding its first general assembly since its president, Meng Hongwei, was detained by China on charges of taking bribes and other crimes.", "title": "Interpol Meets to Select New President After Leader\u2019s Arrest in China"},
{"content": "Western luxury money has been pouring into China at a rapid rate this fall. In the last four weeks alone Richemont, the Swiss owner of brands like Cartier and the e-tailer Yoox Net-a-Porter, announced a joint venture with the Chinese online retail giant Alibaba in a bid to crack the online shopping market of a country now responsible for almost a third of all luxury sales worldwide. Next, Cond\u00e9 Nast International unveiled plans for Vogue Hong Kong, the 26th global version of the fashion title with a print edition published in the traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong and a bilingual website, in Chinese and English. Then, in its latest earnings call, Ralph Lauren said it had opened 10 additional stores in mainland China in the last quarter, putting it on track to open more than 50 by the end of 2019. And Coach said it would stage its first runway show in China on Dec. 8, a blockbuster spectacle and after-party titled \u201cCoach Lights Up Shanghai.\u201d China\u2019s great luxury promise appears to have the sector\u2019s biggest power players well and truly in its thrall. But in the background, dark clouds have also been gathering. A brewing trade war with the United States, the weakening renminbi and the sputtering growth of China\u2019s economy in recent months all have executives on edge. During the fall Golden Week, a holiday period around the Oct. 1 National Day observance when many Chinese consumers splurge on travel and luxury goods, sales grew at the slowest pace since 2000, according to data from China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce. The painful luxury industry downturn that occurred worldwide between 2013 and 2016 in the wake of a Chinese government clampdown on corruption and a spate of terrorist attacks in Europe \u2014 ending years of soaring sales growth \u2014 is still fresh in the minds of many. Could a similar situation be about to unfold again? An inflection point came in early October, at the end of Golden Week, when social media posts showing emptied shopping bags, luggage searches and snaking lines at airport customs checks suggested that the state was cracking down on the practice known as daigou, when Chinese travelers buy high-end merchandise on trips abroad and sell the items at a profit after they return home. Spooked that the appetite for luxury goods in China could tip into a rapid slump, investor jitters prompted a global market sell-off, largely hitting European players such as LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Kering, Richemont, Burberry and Prada. Companies in the United States, like Tapestry and Tiffany & Co., also felt the strain. Some brands have sounded notes of caution about the current and future state of Chinese consumer confidence. \u201cIn the past few months I would say there has been a slowing down of consumption, and probably the Chinese consumer is becoming more careful in what he or she does,\u201d said Ermenegildo Zegna, chief executive of the Italian men\u2019s luxury house of the same name. \u201cI am more cautious than three months ago. For next year, we are going to plan a conservative budget because there are many uncertainties in the air and you have to be realistic.\u201d LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury company by sales and the owner of big-name brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy, acknowledged the customs crackdown in China alongside the risks of operating globally \u201cin an uncertain geopolitical and monetary context,\u201d pointing to Louis Vuitton\u2019s slightly weaker sales to Chinese shoppers in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Kering, which reported a total third quarter revenue rise of 27 percent, to 3.4 billion euros (more than $3.8 billion), and a China revenue jump of 30 percent in the first half of 2018, has still seen a fifth of its share price wiped out since June on fears of a Chinese consumption contraction. According to RBC Capital Markets, a global investment bank in Toronto, similar concerns have produced an average share price decline of 20 percent at luxury companies since mid-May. So what will come next for a sector that Bain & Co. still predicts will grow by 6 to 8 percent, to \u20ac281 billion from \u20ac276 billion, this year? Given the money still being plowed into the region by brands and investors alike, could the stock market be overreacting? \u201cClearly stocks were hit dramatically in past weeks, with investors keen to avoid being stung as they were in the last downturn,\u201d said Erwan Rambourg, global co-head of consumer and retail research at HSBC. \u201cHowever, it is possible that these macro fears are overextended and we can expect more of a soft landing. \u201cWe believe the current \u2018slowdown\u2019 is more to do with being a period of normalization, after two years of phenomenal growth,\u201d he added. \u201cThe sector decline will not be on as steep a slope as the market seems to expect.\u201d Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods equity research at Citigroup, concurred. He noted that many luxury brands had re-evaluated their expansion strategies in China in recent years, particularly around retail networks, targeted digital marketing and pricing, so their business \u2014 and bottom lines \u2014 are better protected in the event of another cyclical downturn. He also added that luxury\u2019s latest bull run had not been wholly dependent on Chinese spending: The American market has improved significantly in the last year, while many brands have posted double-digit sales growth in both Europe and Japan. \u201cClearly China has been the white-hot engine for luxury growth lately \u2014 but this is also a global story, and price harmonization across markets is better than it was a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Chauvet said. \u201cThe central question now should be whether international demand drivers are still in place to support a healthy level of sales and earnings growth over the next 12 months as China moderates.\u201d However, some market observers have highlighted positive consumer trends in China. As the country looks for ways to shore up its domestic economy, the government crackdown on daigou and the lowering of import duties this summer to encourage consumers to make purchases at home rather than chasing lower prices abroad are likely to make their mark, according to Angela Wang, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group and co-author, with the Chinese investment holding conglomerate Tencent, of a recently published study on China\u2019s luxury market. She said that, although Chinese customers now are responsible for 32 percent of luxury goods sales worldwide, that number is still expected to grow to 40 percent by 2024 and power 75 percent growth of the global market. Unsurprisingly, millennials \u2014 particularly educated women \u2014 will be the driving force. \u201cLuxury shoppers in China have an average age of 28, a majority have college degrees and are far better educated than their parents,\u201d Ms. Wang said, noting that more than 50 percent of luxury customers now lived in second- and third-tier cities like Tianjin and Dalian, bolstering the importance of online platforms as there are few premium malls in those locations. \u201cSocial shopping is now 11 percent of total luxury commerce in China and growing at a tremendous rate,\u201d she added. \u201cAll this momentum won\u2019t disappear in the wake of the recent slowdown.\u201d The fact that many major players have continued to double down on their presence in China despite the recent uncertainty suggests that long-term opportunities will continue to trump short-term volatility. Richemont\u2019s deal with Alibaba will allow sites like Net-a-Porter to begin business on Luxury Pavilion, an invitation-only luxury platform on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall site \u2014 even as many Western brands are continuing to be cautious in their embrace of Chinese e-commerce and alliances with local internet platforms, primarily because of fears of counterfeiting and the risk of diluting the exclusivity of their products. Also, the action follows an investment last year by JD.com, Alibaba\u2019s rival, in the luxury online marketplace Farfetch. \u201cOur digital offering in China is in its infancy,\u201d said Johann Rupert, Richemont\u2019s chairman, \u201cand we believe that partnering with Alibaba will enable us to become a significant and sustainable online player in this market.\u201d Western companies are not the only ones looking farther afield to secure growth prospects. Despite the vast market on their doorsteps, a handful of Chinese luxury investors have been exploring a new market of their own in search of greater returns: Europe. This year, Shandong Ruyi bought the Swiss leather brand Bally while Fosun acquired the French fashion house Lanvin, both moves devised to reap profits from their countrymen\u2019s appetite for luxury marques that otherwise would go into the pockets of Western companies. And for all the jitters around Golden Week, Singles Day \u2014 the annual one-day shopping festival founded by Alibaba as a time for Chinese consumers to celebrate being single \u2014 smashed all records Nov. 11 to become the biggest sales event in history.

{"content": "On Aug. 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall about 5 miles east of Rockport, Tex. The category 4 storm had an eye wider than the length of Manhattan, wind gusts up to 145 miles per hour and a 10 foot storm surge. The catastrophic storm resulted in at least 103 deaths in the United States. But amid this destruction, one thing seemed to weather the storm quite well \u2014 spotted seatrout, which were busy making babies as the eye of the hurricane passed over their spawning grounds. \u201cTheir urge to reproduce, or that inclination, is so strong that not even a hurricane can stop them,\u201d Christopher Biggs, a graduate student at The University of Texas at Austin and first author of the study, said. Mr. Biggs and his colleagues reported their discovery, which was based on underwater audio recordings, last week in Biology Letters. The resilience of these fish suggests that they and their relatives, popular for recreational fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, may cope surprisingly well with increases in human activity and other temporary disturbances. To see if the species could reproduce well enough to keep up with recreational fishers, Mr. Biggs and Brad Erisman, a marine biologist and lead author of the study, have been monitoring spotted seatrout reproduction. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Their team has been looking at spawning: when fish cast eggs and sperm into the water that meet, fertilize and develop into a new population, if all goes well. The team wants to know when the fish start, how long they go and how temperature and saltiness, which fluctuate in the estuary near Port Aransas, Tex., might affect their behavior in different locations. But because the water is murky, they can\u2019t just dive in and look. Instead, they rely on these fish\u2019s unusual audible mating calls. In this species, as well as other drum fish named for their sounds, the males cry out in grunts and pulses during spawning. An individual sounds like a panther standing behind a trickling stream of water. And when many call together, they can evoke a chorus of chain saws. Mr. Biggs and his colleagues had deployed underwater microphones in April 2017 at 15 popular spawning grounds. These programmable recording devices are protected inside waterproof casing and strapped to a PVC pipe. To install and remove them, Mr. Biggs had to dive down six or 12 feet and hammer them into the sandy sea bottom. When news of Harvey\u2019s strength and direction was announced, Mr. Biggs was at a conference in Florida. He raced home to Texas and took a boat out to retrieve his recorders. He recovered about half before he had to evacuate, and the storm took most of the rest. Audio analysis of the six months of rescued recordings revealed some surprises. First, despite previous work suggesting spawning coincided with changes in the moon, their survey showed the fish population spawned daily. And then the two recorders that survived the hurricane yielded another unexpected finding. At first, the researchers thought the storm\u2019s noise was too loud to hear anything. But when it calmed, they heard the fish spawning \u2014 the day before the storm, in its eye and the day after. \u201cThat was completely surprising when you consider the total destruction on land,\u201d he said. Following the hurricane, the fish began spawning earlier in the day, possibly cued in part by temperature changes in the water. \u201cYou would think if they felt their environment getting that disrupted, they would just go somewhere else, but yet they were still hunkered down right in the same spots that they had been before,\u201d Mr. Biggs said. Whether they stopped during the worst of it and restarted in the calm, however, we may never know. This year the team has deployed another set of hydrophones to find out why the fish make sounds when they spawn. Is the call more of a social cue to sync spawning after they\u2019ve already gathered? Or is it more like a dinner bell calling out \u201cHey, it\u2019s spawning time in the estuary, come and get it?\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/science/fish-hurricane-harvey.html", "date": "2018-11-15 00:00:00", "author": "By JoAnna Klein", "description": "Underwater audio recordings rescued from Hurricane Harvey showed that the urge to spawn was more powerful than a category 4 storm.", "title": "Hurricane Harvey Passed Over, but These Fish Kept Making Babies"},
{"content": "NAPLES, Fla. \u2014 Lexi Thompson entered the Heavenly Puppies pet store in South Florida this summer, intending to volunteer to walk the dogs. She figured the animals would enjoy some fresh air, and she would enjoy a much-needed escape from her sometimes-suffocating position as the leading American in the women\u2019s golf rankings. As soon as Thompson, 23, slipped through the door, she noticed a puppy cuddled up on a ladybug plush toy. It was a divine sign: Thompson has a ladybug patch on her golf bag and wears ladybug earrings for good luck. She told her mother, Judy: \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. I don\u2019t need to volunteer. I\u2019m getting a dog.\u201d As Thompson returned to the winner\u2019s circle on Sunday at the CME Group Tour Championship after a 14-month winless drought that included a one-month mental-health hiatus, Leo \u2014 a fluffy six-month-old, five-pound Havanese and miniature poodle mix \u2014 was by her side, playing an outsize role. He provided a welcome distraction between rounds of the L.P.G.A. season finale at Tiburon Golf Club, where Thompson shot a 2-under 70 on Sunday to secure a four-stroke victory over Nelly Korda. It also extended her L.P.G.A. title streak to six consecutive years \u2014 the longest run among active players. The win \u2014 Thompson\u2019s 10th on the tour \u2014 provided redemption. Last year, she missed a 2-foot par putt on the final hole at Tiburon with the tournament title, the women\u2019s world No. 1 ranking and Player of the Year honors on the line. Thompson still earned the season points title and the $1 million bonus that went with it, but she lost by one stroke to Ariya Jutanugarn for the tournament trophy. It was a disappointing ending to a difficult year. Thompson had spent most of 2017 trying to get out in front of waves of adversity, only to be dragged under over and over. In the year\u2019s first major, she lost in a playoff after being assessed a four-stroke penalty in the final round for improperly marking her ball on a green in the third round. The infraction, dissected all over social media and the airwaves, made Thompson feel as if her integrity was under attack. She was still reeling from that episode when her mother, a breast cancer survivor whom Thompson describes as her best friend, was found to have uterine cancer in the spring. In the fall, Thompson\u2019s paternal grandmother died. Thompson, who has been in the spotlight since qualifying for the United States Women\u2019s Open as a 12-year-old in 2007, continued pushing herself to perform. But golf, which had always been her sanctuary, became another stressor. By July, she could no longer keep up appearances. She announced that she would skip the Women\u2019s British Open, the first major she missed since becoming an L.P.G.A. member, to attend to her mental health. When she resurfaced in August to defend her Indy Women in Tech Championship, Thompson said, \u201cThe last year and a half, I have honestly been struggling a lot emotionally, and it\u2019s hard because I can\u2019t really show it.\u201d Thompson made one start in September, two in October and two more this month, scaling back her schedule so she could participate in talk therapy and, she said, spend time \u201cjust trying to figure myself out off the golf course.\u201d In an Instagram post last month, Thompson opened up about her body-image issues stemming from her quest to look like fashion and fitness models. \u201cThe only way you\u2019ll ever be truly happy,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis if you love yourself first.\u201d Leo has been perhaps her best form of therapy. His continual affection, expressed by vigorous tail-wagging whenever she picks him up, and his expressive ears, which flip inside-out in excitement when he sees her, are a welcome counter to all the trolls on social media and the pressure of the scorecards. \u201cNo matter what I shoot, this guy is giving me kisses,\u201d Thompson said as she cradled her dog in her arms. It was instructive, Thompson said, to recognize that she loved Leo all the more because of his unruly ears, something others might see as a defect. On some level, it helped her realize how silly it was to invest so much energy in fixing or hiding flaws. \u201cYeah, exactly,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI mean, everybody has imperfections. We\u2019re all not perfect and we have to own it.

{"content": "MIAMI \u2014 There was a time when LeBron James being pestered by Lance Stephenson would have worked out wonderfully for the Miami Heat. Sunday was not one of those times. It was late in the game, the outcome was decided, and Stephenson \u2014 James\u2019s former rival and now his teammate with the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 challenged him to finish the game off with a 3-pointer. \u201cI bet you won\u2019t go for the 3,\u201d Stephenson said. The Heat probably wish that conversation never took place. James capped his 51-point night with a 32-foot 3-pointer in the final seconds, pointed at Stephenson to let him know he was wrong, and the Lakers rolled past the Heat, 113-97, for their seventh win in nine games. James reached 50 for the 13th time in his career, including Game 1 of last season\u2019s N.B.A. finals. \u201cIt\u2019s just playing with greatness,\u201d Lakers guard Lonzo Ball said. \u201cTonight, he took the game over.\u201d James shot 19 for 31 from the field, 6 for 8 from 3-point range, became the seventh player to score at least 51 in a game against Miami, and started his two-game reunion tour in sensational fashion. The Lakers\u2019 next game is Wednesday night in Cleveland, the only place besides Miami and Los Angeles that James has called home as a professional. \u201cIt\u2019s always great to be here,\u201d said James, who hugged a slew of familiar faces in the arena he used to call home. \u201cWe had some not-so-good times, we had more great times, so it\u2019s always a respect factor and a love for the people in Miami and especially the people who work here.\u201d And finally, he left Miami a winner again. Since leaving the Heat after the 2014 N.B.A. finals, James was 0-4 against Miami; his teams were 0-7, including the three Cleveland-Miami games that he missed. While James put on a show, the Heat threw a shoe. It was Miami\u2019s fourth straight home loss. and frustrations boiled over. Josh Richardson was ejected in the fourth quarter after throwing one of his sneakers into the stands, upset about a call against him. Wayne Ellington scored 19 points for Miami (6-10), which is off to its second-worst start in the last 12 years. The Heat were 5-11 at this point of the 2016-17 season, the only other time they have been worse after 16 games in 12 years. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get to work,\u201d Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said. Miami has not forgotten James, obviously \u2014 he still receives loud cheers when introduced in his former home arena \u2014 but just in case anyone in attendance needed a reminder of his game, he delivered. He made eight of his first nine shots and had the whole arsenal working: dunks in transition, step-back 3-pointers, turnarounds from the baseline. \u201cWhen he\u2019s hitting shots like that, what do you want us to do?\u201d Heat center Hassan Whiteside said. Even with James\u2019s greatness, the biggest shot for the Lakers might have come from Brandon Ingram with 3 minutes 46 seconds left. Miami had clawed to eight points behind and the shot clock was about to expire on the Lakers, but Ingram connected on a long jumper from the left wing to make it 104-94. From there, the only drama was whether James would get 50 points. And he did. \u201cJust give him the ball,\u201d Lakers guard Kyle Kuzma said, \u201cand get out of the way.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/sports/lebron-james-lakers-heat-nba.html", "date": "2018-11-18 00:00:00", "author": "By The Associated Press", "description": "It was the first time James won against Miami since leaving the team after the 2014 N.B.A. finals.", "title": "LeBron James Scores 51 Against Heat as Lakers Win"},

Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022 Theresa May: \u201cThe next seven days are critical.\u201d The British prime minister, after days of turmoil over Brexit, said in a television interview that she would head back to Brussels this week, where European leaders are scheduled to discuss a draft agreement on Sunday. But anything can happen before then to upend the process. The deal, reluctantly approved by her cabinet last week, looks unlikely to get a signoff from Parliament. And Mrs. May faces more threats at home. There has been growing momentum for a second referendum, which could force a vote on the terms of the deal and the option to remain in the E.U., and Mrs. May could face a leadership challenge via a secretive panel called the 1922 committee. The group has been collecting letters from members of Mrs. May\u2019s own party stating they\u2019ve lost confidence in her; if the committee receives 48 letters, it can trigger a no-confidence vote. Meanwhile, a U.N. poverty expert reported that the British government\u2019s austerity policies are directly linked to a rise in poverty. Brexit, he said, \u201cposes particular risks for people in poverty, but the government appears to be treating this as an afterthought.\u201d Above, the Houses of Parliament in London. _____ \u2022 Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, depicted left, ordered the brutal killing of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi, depicted right, the C.I.A. concluded. The intelligence agency, previously hesitant to definitively point fingers in the killing of the journalist, changed its tune following two sets of communications: intercepts of the crown prince\u2019s calls in the days before the killing, and calls by the kill team to a senior aide immediately after. The new assessment adds pressure on the Trump administration to punish the kingdom, a longtime American ally. President Trump said he would wait for a report from his own administration before deciding how to assign blame, but a top White House aide responsible for policy toward Riyadh resigned on Friday, revealing possible fractures inside the administration over its response. Separately, although Arab dissidents, journalists and activists on Friday mourned Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death in Istanbul, the Turkish police made a new round of arrests to further suppress domestic dissent.

Here is a breakdown of what happened during the first 12 hours of the  blaze. While firefighters continue to battle the flames, evacuees have gathered in makeshift settlements, wondering how they will pick up the pieces. During his trip to Paradise this weekend, President Trump continued to blame the state\u2019s forest management for the huge wildfires, and recommended following the lead of a forested nation like Finland.

Extreme poverty has fallen from three-quarters of the population in 1984 to less than 1 percent today.

{"content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Mo Williams, a first-year assistant at California State University, Northridge, left the bench a few moments before tipoff Saturday night to offer some last-second advice to Darius Brown II, one of the starting guards. \u201cWe go as you go,\u201d Williams recalled telling him before the game against the University of Portland. \u201cHow we perform tonight is how you start out and get us involved in our offense.\u201d As far as great oratorical moments go, Williams was not exactly channeling Jim Valvano. But his words tend to resonate at Northridge, a midmajor Division I men\u2019s basketball program where the players are very aware of his 13-year N.B.A. career, which included an All-Star selection in 2009 and a championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. \u201cThey all watched,\u201d Northridge Coach Mark Gottfried said, \u201cand they know.\u201d But there is another facet of Williams\u2019s playing career that stands out: his high-profile partnership with LeBron James, who now plies his trade for the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cThere\u2019s a buzz around the city that\u2019s unmatched ever since the day he decided to come to L.A.,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in touch. He\u2019s a busy man, and so am I. I mean, we don\u2019t hang out and grab a beer all the time, but we\u2019re in constant contact, and we have a real genuine respect for each other.\u201d Williams, 35, is charting his own path now, and has been for years, but he is still linked to James as an example of the power that James holds and the influence he wields. As teammates for two seasons, from 2008 to 2010, James and Williams led the Cavaliers to a pair of division titles but twice fell short of advancing to the finals. When James bolted for the Miami Heat in free agency in summer 2010, Williams did something few of his contemporaries have dared to do: publicly criticize James. In a series of late-night tweets, Williams made clear that he was mostly upset with the way James had gone about announcing his decision. But he was also just really sad. \u201cThat\u2019s me being a 26-year-old kid that wanted to have the best player on his team,\u201d Williams said in an interview late Saturday night. \u201cObviously, that was on me \u2014 me being in my feelings, which I\u2019d never been in my life until that instance and haven\u2019t been since.\u201d James, whose departure left the Cavaliers in ruins, and Williams, who was soon traded to the Clippers, eventually resolved their differences, and both players later returned to Cleveland. They were together again for their championship run in 2016 \u2014 Williams as a role player off the bench, James as the greatest player of his generation. Williams later announced his retirement, having begun to transition into the next phase of his life \u2014 as a coach. He was asked Saturday if he misses playing. \u201cOh, absolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cI love what I\u2019m doing. People ask me that all the time. But when I was done, I was done. My body had enough.\u201d Toward the end of his playing career, while teammates were off vacationing in the Caribbean, Williams was spending his summers coaching on the Amateur Athletic Union circuit. He kept a notebook so he could jot down plays. He knew he wanted to coach at the college level someday, he said, so he could have an effect on young players\u2019 lives. Gottfried said that even before he took the job at Northridge in March, he had been in touch with Williams about a potential position. He could sense from the start that Williams had instant credibility with the players, even if most of them were in middle school when he was in his N.B.A. prime. \u201cThey remember the last year or two, when he was in Cleveland and he won a championship,\u201d said Gottfried, who coached Williams at Alabama. \u201cThey understand that he was an N.B.A. All-Star at one point, and that he was a champion. We always joke and say that LeBron had the luxury of playing with him for all those years.\u201d Williams appears to have a light touch with his players. \u201cHe\u2019s like a big brother to us,\u201d the sophomore guard Terrell Gomez said. \u201cSometimes, I even forget that he was an N.B.A. player.\u201d Williams, who has five sons \u2014 \u201cI stay pretty busy,\u201d he said \u2014 and made more than $65 million during his playing career, does not necessarily need to be grinding out long days as a college assistant. But he loves the game, he said, and has great patience for the process of coaching, which seems to be coming in handy. On Saturday, Northridge blew an 18-point lead in an 80-77 loss. The game was played before a modest crowd, but it was not without its own brand of star power. Metta World Peace, the former power forward who won a championship with the Lakers, and Alfonso Ribeiro, the actor best known for his role as Carlton Banks on \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\u201d took in the festivities. Before he headed back to his office for another late night studying game film, Williams took a few minutes to reflect on his new job \u2014 and an old teammate. James is about to make another splashy return to Cleveland, for the Lakers\u2019 game against the Cavaliers there on Wednesday. Williams expects him to be greeted warmly. \u201cI honestly think that there has to be love and respect coming from both sides,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe brought a championship to the franchise, and he\u2019s done so much for the city. So it\u2019s almost like they have to bless him, bless his future, wish him the best and thank him for what he\u2019s done.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/sports/basketball/mo-williams-lebron-james.html", "date": "2018-11-18 00:00:00", "author": "By Scott Cacciola", "description": "Williams is an assistant at a college in Los Angeles, where his best-known former teammate has relocated his crown.

{"content": "LONDON \u2014 Alexander Zverev claimed the biggest title of his career on Sunday, winning the ATP Finals with a 6-4, 6-3 upset of Novak Djokovic. Zverev, 21, became the youngest champion of the season-ending event since Djokovic claimed the first of his five titles a decade ago \u2014 also at age 21. But Zverev is not ready to make any comparisons. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d said Zverev, who also became the first German winner since 1995. \u201cI\u2019ve won one. He\u2019s won five. He\u2019s won, I don\u2019t know what, 148 titles more than me. Let\u2019s not go there for now.\u201d Djokovic, the top-ranked men\u2019s player, was attempting to tie Roger Federer\u2019s record of six titles in the event. But he followed the same path as Federer, who lost to Zverev in the semifinals at the O2 Arena on Saturday. Djokovic\u2019s serve had not been broken in the tournament until the final match. Zverev did it once in the first set and three times in the second, completing the victory with a spectacular backhand winner up the line. For his part, Djokovic, who ended a two-year Grand Slam title drought by winning Wimbledon this year, noted the similarities in his and Zverev\u2019s career trajectories. \u201cHopefully he can surpass me,\u201d Djokovic said. Both players began the match in the same form in which they had earned straight-sets semifinal wins a day earlier, with few points going against the server. It was Djokovic, who had lost just two of his previous 37 matches and had defeated Zverev in the round-robin stage, who began to feel the pressure when he made two straight forehand errors to give up his first break of the tournament, for 5-4. Fans gave Zverev an ovation as he stepped up to serve for the set, and it seemed to inspire him. Three straight aces brought up three set points, the second of which he took when Djokovic sent another forehand long. \u201cFrom 4-4 in the first set, my game really fell apart,\u201d Djokovic said. A 26-shot rally brought up another break opportunity in the opening game of the second set, and although Djokovic saved it, Zverev won another lengthy exchange moments later with a forehand winner to go up by 1-0. With the biggest win of his career in sight, Zverev began to show some nerves. Although he is the only active male player outside the so-called Big Four \u2014 Djokovic, Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray \u2014 who possesses at least three Masters titles, Zverev has reached only one Grand Slam quarterfinal. Two double faults and two backhand errors gave Djokovic an immediate break back, but Zverev quickly refocused to win a 28-shot rally on his way to breaking in the next game. From there he remained solid on serve, before ending with a flourish. A backhand winner on the run drifted past the helpless Djokovic, and Zverev sank to the ground in tears. \u201cThis trophy means a lot, everything,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cYou only have so many chances of winning it. You play against the best players only.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/sports/alexander-zverev-upsets-novak-djokovic-for-first-atp-finals-title.html", "date": "2018-11-18 00:00:00", "author": "By The Associated Press", "description": "At 21, Zverev became the youngest ATP Finals champion since Djokovic, who also won the event at 21, in 2008.", "title": "Alexander Zverev Upsets Novak Djokovic for First ATP Finals Title"},
{"content": "HOMESTEAD, Fla. \u2014 With 12 laps to go in Nascar\u2019s top series, Joey Logano passed his archrival, Martin Truex Jr., and then held on to win the 267-lap season finale and the series championship on Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Logano, 28, beat out his fellow championship finalists \u2014 Truex, Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick, all former champions \u2014 for his first title. The four contenders battled one another at the front of the field for much of the thrilling finale. Busch, who had gambled on fuel and tires, appeared to have the advantage as the final stretch approached. But on a restart after a caution period with 20 laps to go, he was not able to hold off Logano and Truex. He faded to fourth, behind Harvick. Logano surged alongside Truex before passing him and holding on for the win. In 2016, Logano had a disappointing runner-up finish, and said that setback prepared him for this year\u2019s clincher. \u201cI\u2019ve worked my whole life to get here,\u201d said Logano, who drove a Ford for Team Penske. \u201cI knew my car was good on short runs, and that last 20 laps under green was just how I wanted the race to play out.\u201d The race, taking place under near-perfect weather conditions southwest of Miami, had a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu about it, as the so-called championship four was largely the same as it was last year. Busch, Truex and Kevin Harvick were back for another year as finalists Logano replaced his teammate Brad Keselowski from the 2017 lineup. Despite the Nascar adage that \u201cyou need friends out on the racetrack\u201d to help you do well, those four have excelled year after year despite being considered to be among the prickliest competitors in the sport. After Logano bumped Truex during the final lap at Martinsville last month before surging ahead to win, Truex promised, \u201cI know he won\u2019t win the championship.\u201d It was not the first run-in with a competitor for Logano; Denny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth have intentionally wrecked him before. Logano said he expected an even higher level of intensity for the final. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you are,\u201d he said. \u201cYou find another gear here. A higher gear.\u201d Busch, the regular-season champion, was candid about his feelings toward certain drivers in the series. \u201cSometime you just don\u2019t like a guy,\u201d he said simply. Dale Earnhardt Jr., who often crossed paths with Busch during his career, said, \u201cHe drives hard, and he doesn\u2019t care who gets in the way.\u201d One of Harvick\u2019s team owners, Tony Stewart, a notoriously pugnacious driver who retired last year, said Harvick, the 2014 series champion, thrived in high-pressure situations. \u201cKevin\u2019s the guy who, if there\u2019s five seconds to go, is the guy who you want to get the ball to. You want it in his hands,\u201d Stewart said. Busch and Harvick had each won a season-leading eight races this year to help them get into the Homestead finale. Truex, the 2017 champion, qualified with four victories and a big cache of points. Logano peaked in the nine races preceding the final event. \u201cWe were the favorite. We executed down the stretch like nobody\u2019s business,\u201d Logano told reporters after Sunday\u2019s race. The battle among the car manufacturers was another case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: It was the second year in a row that Toyota, with Truex and Busch, and Ford, with Logano and Harvick, squared off for the title. And for a second straight year, Chevrolet, which fields the most entries, was shut out. Chevrolet\u2019s motor sports director, Jim Campbell, said that development was \u201cdisappointing.\u201d But, he noted, Chevrolet introduced a new car, the Camaro, to the series, and the teams struggled as they tried to sort out the new automobile. T he results improved as the season went on, and the fan favorite Chase Elliott, a Chevrolet driver, won three of the last 15 races; he was not eliminated from the Championship 4 until the next-to-last race. Harvick barely made the field, after his car was ruled illegal three races from the season\u2019s end. His crew chief, Rodney Childers, was suspended for the remainder of the season, and the team lost a critical number of points and an automatic berth in the final. So Harvick had to race his way back in over the remaining races. The season finale also marked a turning of the chapter for some in Nascar. Truex\u2019s team went out of business, having lost its major sponsor. The seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson finished without a victory for the first time in 16 seasons, and his longtime crew chief, Chad Knaus, is moving to another team.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/sports/nascar-homestead-joey-logano.html", "date": "2018-11-18 00:00:00", "author": "By Jerry Garrett", "description": "Logano beat out Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick at Homestead-Miami to clinch his first championship.", "title": "Joey Logano Wins Top Nascar Series, Holding Off 3 Predecessors"},
{"content": "When Jaspreet Kaur was a junior at Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J., she and her best friend, Ndonga Sagnia, worked part time at the college help desk. Between fielding calls for technical help, they passed the time on Pinterest, making wedding boards. Though both were unattached 20-year-old accounting students at the time, Ms. Sagnia remembers Ms. Kaur outlining a few must-haves for her future wedding. \u201cShe liked a lot of greenery, and there was this flower crown she wanted to wear that was really earthy and ethereal,\u201d said Ms. Sagnia, a certified public accountant in Harrison, N.J. One thing Ms. Kaur, now 26 and also a C.P.A., was unsure about was whether she would find her future husband herself, or if her parents would arrange her marriage. \u201cObviously I knew there were people out there who meet someone and fall in love and have a love marriage,\u201d said Ms. Kaur, whose parents immigrated from Punjab, India, in the 1980s and now live in Bordentown, N.J. But arranged marriages, from her perspective, can have a lot to offer. \u201cPeople think, why would you ever want your parents to choose your spouse,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I say, Are you kidding me? If my parents are going to set me up with someone who\u2019s educated and stable and from a nice family, those are major boxes to check. I was definitely open to it.\u201d As it happened, Ms. Kaur met Gregory Mattson, the man she intends to spend the rest of her life with, in a much different way: on the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel. The trajectory of her love marriage was as studded with unknowns as an arranged married might have been. Mr. Mattson, 26 and a graduate student in physics at the University of Illinois, was climbing a mountain near Pennsylvania with a buddy in June 2015 when he saw that Ms. Kaur was his \u201cbagel of the day,\u201d the site\u2019s parlance for the person he was matched with and had 24 hours to pursue. \u201cI was checking my phone now and then, but I had no signal,\u201d he said. It was late in the day by the time he kicked the dirt off his boots and saw a picture of a wavy haired, big-smiling Indian woman on the app. \u201cI had to make a quick decision. I was like, yes, let\u2019s try this.\u201d Days later, after a flurry of texts in which they found that Mr. Mattson\u2019s best friend since sixth grade, Corey Wu, was an accounting classmate of Ms. Kaur\u2019s at Rider, they met in Princeton, a town between their then-residences, his in Old Bridge and hers in Morristown. Coffee was the plan. But the parts of Mr. Mattson\u2019s profile that initially attracted Ms. Kaur, including his work at the time as a physics researcher at Rutgers University, proved worth exploring in a more in-depth way. After coffee they decided to have dinner, then go for a walk and have ice cream, and walk some more. Their date lasted seven hours, past 2 a.m. \u201cGreg was just this cute guy with really blue eyes, and I like to learn and he was a researcher, and I was like, great, he\u2019s interesting,\u201d Ms. Kaur said. Most of the men she had been meeting online were not. \u201cI kept coming across finance bros; they\u2019re very into themselves,\u201d she said. The prospect of dating someone her parents selected \u2014 someone Indian who practiced Sikhism, like them \u2014 was on the back burner after a series of unsuccessful phone setups in her early 20s. \u201cIt never got to an actual date,\u201d with suitors her parents chose, Ms. Kaur said. But if her parents were disappointed, they didn\u2019t let on. \u201cOf course they wanted it to work out, but I don\u2019t think they took it personally,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they never made me feel like I was doing something wrong that was making it impossible to arrange my marriage. I think they realized that it\u2019s just not as easy as people think. Especially here in the U.S.\u201d Ms. Kaur was not thinking about marriage after her first few dates with Mr. Mattson. Too much was unsettled with him. He knew around the time of their first date that soon he would be applying to graduate schools. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I\u2019d end up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe agreed early on, after two or three dates, that what we had was good, but that we weren\u2019t that serious yet, so we shouldn\u2019t start planning any big decisions around it.\u201d Ms. Kaur accepted Mr. Mattson\u2019s imminent move without reservations. \u201cWe were on the same page about it,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, let\u2019s just be honest with each other.\u201d Not that she hadn\u2019t daydreamed about moving far from New Jersey with Mr. Mattson. \u201cA lot of times when you\u2019re in an arranged marriage you don\u2019t meet someone from down the street, you end up moving,\u201d she said. Despite her closeness to her parents and extended family in New Jersey, \u201cI knew moving away would be a possibility if I went that route.\u201d Moving for a love marriage would be the same: hard but doable. When Mr. Mattson was accepted to the University of Illinois and moved to Urbana in the fall of 2016, neither was ready to call the relationship quits, even temporarily. \u201cWe were talking as much as possible,\u201d Mr. Mattson said. \u201cWe found this app where we could log in and share a screen so we could watch movies together.\u201d They also went on formal \u201cvideo dates.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d both pick up the same takeout and have dinner together, on our computers,\u201d Ms. Kaur said. \u201cGreg would wear a button-up and tie, and I would no longer be in sweatpants.\u201d By the start of his second year in graduate school, Mr. Mattson was ready to propose. He had never met her family. (Both sets of parents declined to be named because of privacy concerns.) \u201cI remember sitting down and giving the idea of getting engaged some actual thought. Like, Is this the best thing? Is this what I want?,\u201d he said. From his Urbana apartment, \u201cI decided yes.\u201d Mr. Mattson knew Ms. Kaur\u2019s parents would likely not have included him on a shortlist of most eligible grooms. When Ms. Kaur arranged a Sunday brunch at her parents\u2019 house during Mr. Mattson\u2019s visit in October 2017, he was nervous. \u201cThere was this layer of being nervous to meet your significant other\u2019s parents as a baseline. Then there was the whole other layer of the cultural issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how forward-thinking her parents would be.\u201d Ms. Kaur convinced him they would be welcoming. And they were. A few months later, Mr. Mattson whisked Ms. Kaur off to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios in Orlando. \u201cWe\u2019re both big Harry Potter fans. It\u2019s one of the first things we talked about on the dating app, before we even exchanged numbers,\u201d Mr. Mattson said. On Jan. 3, after a full day at the amusement park during which he had to beg a security guard not to make him empty his pockets \u2014 they contained a moissanite solitaire ring he bought in Chicago \u2014 he proposed in the hotel room. \u201cOne of the elements in the first \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 book is an enchanted mirror that doesn\u2019t show your reflection, but what you truly desire,\u201d he said. \u201cI stood in front of the mirror with her and said, You know what I see? It\u2019s a yes.\u201d Then he dropped to one knee and proposed. Ms. Kaur said she was too overwhelmed to verbalize a response. \u201cI just nodded like an idiot and cried. I couldn\u2019t speak for like 10 minutes.\u201d When an engaged couple\u2019s religions don\u2019t match, bride and groom often choose a nondenominational ceremony or default to the more religious partner\u2019s traditions. Ms. Kaur wasn\u2019t comfortable with those options. \u201cFor my family, it was definitely important that we had a Sikh ceremony, but I couldn\u2019t imagine saying, \u2018This is how we\u2019re going to get married\u2019 without considering what\u2019s important to Greg,\u201d she said. On Oct. 26, at St. Thomas the Apostle Church in Old Bridge, they were married by Mr. Mattson\u2019s uncle, the Rev. Frank Fellrath, a Roman Catholic priest. A dinner was then held for family and close friends. The 10-person bridal party, in long, autumn-inspired burgundy dresses, included Ms. Sagnia, and on the grooms\u2019 side, Mr. Wu. Ms. Kaur wore a traditional white wedding gown in an A-line shape with a lace, boat-neck top, Mr. Mattson a royal blue suit. About 90 guests lined the pews, some who had made the trip from India. The following morning, at the Central Jersey Sikh Association in Windsor, N.J., there was a ceremony led by a Granthi Balwinder Singh, who read from the Sikh holy book known as the Guru Granth Sahib. Ms. Kaur wore a beaded, shimmering lehngha \u2014 a long, full skirt \u2014 in cranberry and a matching peplum top custom-made in Patiala, India, by the same shop that made wedding dresses for her mother and several aunts decades ago. Mr. Mattson wore a traditional Sikh wedding sherwani in gold silk and a burgundy head scarf, and carried a kirpan, or sheathed sword, a Sikh tradition. About 200 guests, all shoeless and wearing head coverings, sat on a carpeted floor in the gurdwara, or marriage hall. After initial prayers, accompanied by three turbaned, heavily bearded granthis playing hand drums and harmonium, the granthi placed a scarf worn by Mr. Mattson in Ms. Kaur\u2019s hands. Bride and groom were then instructed to stand and circle the holy book a total of four times, with pauses to sit and pray between each round. Ten male relatives standing at intervals around the holy book were there to symbolically \u201cpass off\u201d Ms. Kaur to Mr. Mattson, and make it known that they will continue to nurture and protect her once she leaves home. After the holidays, Ms. Kaur will move to Illinois and start looking for accounting work. \u201cI\u2019m really going to miss my family,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be different and it\u2019s going to be difficult.\u201d But she is also sure that it will be worth it. \u201cI love Greg so much,\u201d she said at a reception held after the Sikh ceremony, at the Merion in Cinnaminson, N.J. She had removed the crown of flowers she wore at the Roman Catholic ceremony, and the baby\u2019s breath she wove into her hair at the Sikh ceremony. But she still looked ethereal.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/fashion/weddings/a-dating-app-not-the-parents-brought-them-together.html", "date": "2018-11-16 00:00:00", "author": "By Tammy La Gorce", "description": "\u201cIf my parents are going to set me up with someone who\u2019s educated and stable and from a nice family, those are major boxes to check.\u201d", "title": "A Dating App, Not the Parents, Brought Them Together"},
{"content": "Hi and welcome to Five Weeknight Dishes, pre-Thanksgiving edition. I have dinner ideas for you for the week to come, whether you\u2019re traveling, waiting for a wave of family to come in, or just lying low. I have a dessert for you, too: Julia Turshen\u2019s one-bowl, one-pan applesauce cake with cream cheese frosting from her new cookbook, \u201cNow & Again.\u201d I\u2019d seen people posting photos of it on Instagram, and so I made it on election night as I waited for the returns (the technical term for that is distractibaking). I was charmed: a nice cake you can pull off on a weeknight! It\u2019s moist, autumnal and not too sweet, ideal for novices to make for Thanksgiving or for anyone to keep around for snacking all week. I also asked Julia what she makes on weeknights when she\u2019s too tired to cook. She revels in repurposing leftovers; if there aren\u2019t any, though, she goes with eggs. \u201cI love to make a big diner-style omelet with some cheese,\u201d she told me over email. \u201cOr a kimchi-and-cheese omelet with sliced cucumbers on the side and my favorite ever super-fast salad dressing, which is equal parts kimchi juice and mayonnaise.\u201d (Ooh!) So what are you cooking this week? Need suggestions? Have thoughts for me? I\u2019m dearemily@nytimes.com. Here are five dishes for the week: 1. Sheet-Pan Chicken With Apple, Fennel and Onion Speaking of autumnal \u2014 it\u2019s fall on a sheet pan, perfect for this week. If you\u2019re pressed for time (or patience) you could skip the toasted fennel seeds, but they really do deepen the flavor of the dish. Serve with a green salad, or saut\u00e9ed kale or spinach. View this recipe in your weekly plan. _____ 2. Slow-Roasted Citrus Salmon With Herb Salad The term \u201cslow-roasted\u201d is relative here \u2014 the fish still cooks in about 30 minutes, and it is utterly delicious and worth all the olive oil it bathes in. This recipe is easy enough to make anytime, but special enough to make for company. Double it if you need to, and serve with rice or farro and saut\u00e9ed green beans, chopping extra fresh herbs to scatter on top. View this recipe in your weekly plan. _____ 3. Broccoli-Walnut Pesto Pasta An excellent, appealing, veg-packed idea. Blanched broccoli and mint replace the basil in pesto, walnuts sub in for pine nuts, and lemon brightens it all. I don\u2019t think you need another vegetable, but roasted carrots would be good for a sweater-weather meal. This dish travels well and can be served at room temperature. View this recipe in your weekly plan. _____ 4. Sheet-Pan Cumin Pork Chops and Brussels Sprouts Another sheet-pan supper! I\u2019m guessing two isn\u2019t too many, though. (A friend told me she\u2019d love it if this newsletter consisted solely of sheet-pan recipes.) This recipe is written for two smaller pans, but you could definitely do it all on one big sheet pan: Put pork on one side, sprouts on the other. Remove the chops from the pan to rest and return the sprouts to the oven to finish cooking. Voila. View this recipe in your weekly plan. _____ 5. Omelet An omelet is a perfect dinner for one or two, and it\u2019s equally delicious to go high (fill with fancy cheese) or low (fill with American cheese). If you\u2019ve ever made a less-than-exquisite omelet, follow the excellent directions on this recipe and watch the video, too. Serve with salad greens and toast, extra butter.

{"content": "Les Miles, the colorful former Louisiana State coach who led the Tigers to a national title in the 2007 season, will be the next coach at Kansas. It is a high-profile hire for Kansas\u2019 football team, one of the rare power-conference programs overshadowed by its university\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team. While the Jayhawks basketball team \u2014 started by the sport\u2019s founder, James Naismith \u2014 is a perennial power with three N.C.A.A. tournament championships, the football program has languished, averaging about 1.9 wins a season over the previous eight years. Miles\u2019s \u201cnational reputation as a great recruiter and as a coach who student-athletes love playing for will enable us to break the cycle and return a winning tradition to the Kansas Jayhawks,\u201d the athletic director, Jeff Long, said in a statement announcing the hiring on Sunday. This month, Long, who started at Kansas this year after 10 years at Arkansas, announced that the fourth-year coach David Beaty would not return after this season. The Jayhawks are 3-8 with one game remaining \u2014 a marked improvement over the last three seasons, in which they had a combined three wins. Miles, 65, had been considered the front-runner since the job opened up, especially after L.S.U. announced last week that it had settled a buyout of his contract. Long and Miles overlapped for three years at Michigan 30 years ago, when Long was a graduate assistant and administrator and Miles was an assistant under Bo Schembechler. Kansas made a similarly splashy football hire in 2012 with Charlie Weis, a former Notre Dame coach. But the team went 6-22 before he was fired early in his third season. In Miles, Kansas is again getting a known commodity \u2014 for better and for worse. Miles was hugely successful at L.S.U., going 114-34 with a national title in the 2007 season and a second title-game appearance four years later, but was let go after four games during the 2016 season. He was also Oklahoma State\u2019s coach for four seasons. His colorful personality \u2014 known as the Mad Hatter because of his affinity for hats, he would pluck grass from Tiger Stadium\u2019s turf and chomp on it during tense moments \u2014 endeared him to fans. However, Miles has been criticized for unorthodox game management and a stubborn refusal to adapt his conservative, Schembechler-esque offense for the current era of spread, pass-happy concepts. He recruited extraordinarily well, though L.S.U.\u2019s status as a national power surely helped. Ultimately, Miles lost a few too many games to Alabama and Nick Saban, the Crimson Tide coach who had revived the Tigers as Miles\u2019s immediate predecessor in Baton Rouge. Miles\u2019s contract with Kansas, which could contain bonuses, is for five years with a base annual salary of $2.775 million, making him the lowest-paid coach in the Big 12 Conference. \u201cWe will bring Jayhawk Football back,\u201d Miles said in a statement, \u201cand we will do it with outstanding coaches, tremendous student-athletes of character and ability, and an unrelenting drive for excellence.\u201d Aside from an Orange Bowl victory under Coach Mark Mangino after the 2007 season, though, the Jayhawks do not have much football tradition. The basketball team\u2019s success largely compensated for many years of football woes, but the economics of college sports today make fielding a competitive football team all but imperative for even the biggest basketball universities. As a member of the Big 12, which lost several members to other leagues in the latest round of conference realignment, Kansas may feel a special burden to ramp up its fortunes in the most lucrative college sport. In the middle of the next decade, several college sports media contracts will expire, creating circumstances ripe for further realignment.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/sports/les-miles-kansas.html", "date": "2018-11-18 00:00:00", "author": "By Marc Tracy", "description": "Miles, who coached L.S.U. to a national title in the 2007 season, will be tasked with reviving one of the country\u2019s worst power-conference programs.", "title": "Kansas, Seeking Lift in Football, Hires Les Miles as Coach"},
{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the debate rages among Democrats about how best to position the party to defeat President Trump in 2020, many big donors are signaling early support for expanding and firing up the party\u2019s liberal base rather than backing centrist appeals targeting the Rust Belt. Even though middle-of-the-road Democrats helped propel the party to broad gains in the House in the midterm elections this month, especially in coastal suburbs, influential donors signaled in postelection meetings that their priority would be to back progressive appeals in Sun Belt states. Efforts in particular to register and mobilize minority and low-income voters in the South and Southwest, they said, present greater potential return on investment for Democrats than trying to win back the white Midwestern voters who helped elect Mr. Trump. While left-leaning Democrats fell short in some high-profile races across the South \u2014 most notably Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s effort to defeat Senator Ted Cruz in Texas and Stacey Abrams\u2019s narrow loss in her campaign to become governor of Georgia \u2014 the gains they made underscored the changing demographics of traditionally Republican states and the long-term opportunity for Democrats, the donors said. \u201cOnce we expand the electorate in these places, there will be no turning back,\u201d said Tory Gavito, the president and co-founder of a new coalition of mostly female donors called Way to Win. She made her case in presentations to major donors at a conference sponsored by WDN Action, the political arm of the Women Donors Network, earlier this month in Seattle and this past week at another put on by the Democracy Alliance, an organization that includes some of the party\u2019s wealthiest and most influential donors. She promoted the impact of her group\u2019s \u201cNew Southern Strategy,\u201d which included steering $22 million to political efforts in the South and Southwest before the midterms. \u201cThe concentration of young people, poor people and people of color who used to sit on the sidelines because Democrats have not inspired them will upend the map,\u201d she said in an interview. That assessment aligns with the passions of the party\u2019s increasingly powerful small-donor base, creating a potentially potent early financial foundation for prospective presidential candidates who appeal to the party\u2019s left flank. The nominating process remains in its earliest stages, and there is nothing approaching unanimity among Democrats and their financial supporters about the best path to 2020, much less the best candidate. Many of those likely to run will try to straddle the party\u2019s ideological, geographical and generational divides, even as Mr. Trump continues to face challenges that could reshape the political landscape before Election Day. But at the recent donor conferences, centrist groups and think tanks affiliated with the moderate wing of the Democratic Party mostly took a back seat to organizations promoting more liberal ground organizing efforts focused on expanding the electoral map. At the annual winter meeting of the Democracy Alliance at a downtown Washington hotel this past week, the agenda featured groups focused on registering and mobilizing voters in Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. The description for a session moderated by Ms. Gavito on \u201cbuilding progressive power in red states\u201d declared that \u201cone clear message of 2018 is that the progressive electoral map is widening,\u201d and could include Sun Belt states, and even deep-red states like Alaska, thanks to long-term investments in ground organizing. Conference leaders credited such efforts with helping progressive Democrats such as Mr. O\u2019Rourke, Ms. Abrams and Andrew Gillum, who narrowly lost the governor\u2019s race in Florida, run more competitive races than they otherwise might have. The leaders of several groups that worked to mobilize minority voters \u2014 including Black Voters Matter, BlackPAC, New Florida Majority and Color of Change \u2014 were granted coveted spots at the conference, allowing them to develop potentially lucrative relationships with the major donors in attendance. Since its creation in 2005, the Democracy Alliance has played a significant role in shaping the institutional ecosystem of the political left by steering more than $1.6 billion to recommended liberal and Democratic groups, according to an alliance official. It has helped to fund an array of new nonprofit groups dedicated to taking on Mr. Trump. Its ranks include some of the left\u2019s most prolific donors, such as the billionaire investors George Soros and Tom Steyer. This past week\u2019s meeting drew appearances from several Democratic politicians, including Representatives Adam B. Schiff of California and Pramila Jayapal of Washington, as well as Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Governor-elect Jared Polis of Colorado, a former Democracy Alliance donor. The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, a favorite of the donor class whose bid to be elected House speaker has been complicated by opposition from her party\u2019s left flank, appeared with a handful of newly elected female Democratic members of Congress at a reception on Friday night celebrating female leaders. She was introduced as \u201cthe original badass woman in Washington and the next speaker of the House\u201d by Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, according to an attendee. At the conference, which was closed to journalists, hundreds of donors and operatives kibitzed and debated the lessons of the midterms and the party\u2019s options for 2020 in formal sessions and sideline gaggles. A New York Times reporter was escorted by an alliance staff member away from a second-floor banquet hall that hosted catered meals and a Thursday evening reception with an open bar and passed hors d\u2019oeuvres, including tuna poke in waffle cones, and prosciutto and mozzarella skewers with a balsamic glaze. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, most donors seemed bullish on the emerging strategy, which amounts to a shift of sorts. In the weeks after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, some in the group had warned of dire consequences if the party did not win back the white suburban and Rust Belt voters who had voted Democratic in recent presidential elections before swinging to Mr. Trump. \u201cThe data bears out that there is in fact a new American majority of people of color and progressive white voters,\u201d said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance donor who participated in a Thursday panel about winning elections in the age of Trump. Mr. Phillips, who was solicited afterward by a succession of activists seeking support for groups targeting minority voters, said in an interview that \u201ca lot of the donors are stepping up\u201d to support such groups. Mr. Phillips has long called for Democrats to forsake centrist appeals and candidates, including in the 2020 presidential primary, and he suggested that other donors would be wise to do the same. \u201cWe should certainly reduce the amount of resources we put in that direction if we want to win,\u201d he said. Gara LaMarche, the president of the Democracy Alliance, did not dispute the club\u2019s heightened focus on progressive organizing, but he said that it was not mutually exclusive with policy work and efforts to appeal to Rust Belt voters. \u201cIt\u2019s not about abandoning white working-class voters,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s about expanding the electorate and giving people reason to vote.\u201d In a speech to the assembled donors on Thursday, he praised \u201cunapologetically progressive candidates who excite and inspire core progressive voters,\u201d according to his prepared remarks. And he singled out the efforts of other groups and donor coalitions that steered funds to help such candidates, including Way to Win. Way to Win is funded in large part by more than 120 female donors, including Susan Pritzker, a member of the family whose fortune stems from Hyatt Hotels. She traced her involvement in the coalition to the 2016 election, which she called \u201ca brutal wake-up call, throwing into sharp relief how broken our democratic processes had become.\u201d Way to Win consists of a political action committee called Way to Lead that donated money this year directly to candidates and a pair of nonprofit groups that donated millions more to groups organizing in those candidates\u2019 states, with a particular focus on Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Virginia and Texas. The goal is \u201cto shift the way political giving happens\u201d away from advertising and other outreach done by national groups, and toward ground organizing controlled by local groups, according to one of the group\u2019s founders, Leah Hunt-Hendrix. A granddaughter of the Texas oil billionaire H. L. Hunt, Ms. Hunt-Hendrix, who is also a Democracy Alliance member, is among the most influential young donors on the left. \u201cOne of the problems with political giving on the right and the left is when it\u2019s used to move a donor\u2019s agenda, whether it\u2019s Wall Street, tech or oil,\u201d Ms. Hunt-Hendrix said in an interview. Way to Win was created to counter factions of the Democratic donor class that she said were \u201csocially liberal but unwilling to challenge corporate power and the accumulation and concentration of wealth.\u201d In an op-ed article last year, she suggested that donors boycott nonprofit groups aligned with the Democratic establishment, such as the centrist think tank Third Way and the nonprofits spearheaded by the conservative-turned-liberal operative David Brock. She deemed those groups part of the \u201cneoliberal wing of the Democratic Party,\u201d which she blamed for thwarting progressive movements like the 2016 primary campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. But Mr. Brock and his groups still garner significant support from the party\u2019s major donor class, including from Democracy Alliance members. One of his groups hosted a dinner presentation on Wednesday night highlighting its 2018 efforts, which drew more than 40 top donors. And Matt Bennett, an executive at Third Way, said it would be \u201cinsane\u201d to minimize efforts to win back traditional \u201cblue wall\u201d states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that Mr. Trump won in 2016. \u201cBy all means, let\u2019s try to engage more voters in these emerging places like the South,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to try to extend ourselves into tough states while neglecting to rebuild in the states where we traditionally won presidential races would be political malpractice.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/17/us/politics/democratic-donors-2020.html", "date": "2018-11-17 00:00:00", "author": "By Kenneth P.

{"content": "Elba Roman knew she wanted the apartment from the moment she laid eyes on it. She had seen other places, but this one stood out. \u201cI saw this building, and I took a picture across the street, and I said, \u2018I want the second floor because it has the deck,\u2019\u201d Ms. Roman said, sitting on her couch as light filled the living room. Portraits of her family covered the walls. Small furniture and toys for her grandchildren lined the sides of the rooms. Ms. Roman, 53, worked hard to make this apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn her own, buying it in 2012 with assistance from Habitat for Humanity. The organization\u2019s home purchase program requires recipients to put in \u201csweat equity,\u201d working on their new home and other Habitat projects. She worked 200 hours; her two adult sons each contributed 100 hours, too. Ms. Roman smiled, remembering how she had worked alongside her sons toward a new home. \u201cI did what I had to do,\u201d she said. But in the years since her purchase, Ms. Roman has experienced job loss and medical problems, and is now in foreclosure, facing more than $40,000 in back mortgage payments. \u201cIf I lose the apartment and I don\u2019t have a choice, I\u2019ll move in with my sister,\u201d she said. \u201cI started packing just in case, that\u2019s why the apartment is a mess. I don\u2019t want to get caught out there and have to leave. I started giving stuff away. The only thing I\u2019m concerned about are the dogs.\u201d Snoozing in a back bedroom, Ms. Roman\u2019s dogs, a Jack Russell and Chihuahua mix named Ruby and a Boston terrier named Nala, have health issues of their own. \u201cIt\u2019s so stressful,\u201d she said recently, holding back tears. \u201cWhat are you going to do when you have pets? I\u2019m not going to give them away. They\u2019re like my kids.\u201d Life did not always feel so volatile for Ms. Roman. She grew up in Brooklyn and worked as a bookkeeper at a real estate firm for 20 years. She sometimes held down multiple jobs, including night shifts at postal distribution center in Bethpage, N.Y., to make ends meet. But in 2009, her health began to fail. Over the course of a year, she had a ruptured colon, gallbladder surgery, a full abdominal reconstruction and hernia surgery. When she felt up to it, Ms. Roman went back to work and began working toward buying an affordable home through Habitat to find a better place to live for her and her sons. She achieved her goal six years ago. Ms. Roman continued to work from home with the real estate firm until four years ago, when the company folded. At first she was able to continue paying the mortgage and maintenance fees on the condo. But when money got tighter, she began paying one and not the other, ping-ponging on payments each month until eventually she could not afford either. Through Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Ms. Roman received $1,178 in July, which helped her pay off her outstanding utility bills. But they continue to pile up. She receives $421 a month in public assistance and $192 a month in food stamps. She\u2019s been denied Social Security benefits twice (an appeal is pending). Ms. Roman said she \u201cis in pain all the time.\u201d Last year, doctors performed a spinal fusion procedure on her back, and she recently received a knee replacement. She was not able to find another job that did not require her to commute, she said, an activity that exacerbates her existing pain. Ms. Roman\u2019s goals are to get healthy enough to be able to play more in the park with her grandchildren and walk her dogs, and find work that allows her to pay off her bills, maybe by taking online college courses. \u201cJust the regular stuff, I want to be able to do regular stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for too much, just the basics.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/neediest-cases/neediest-cases-she-worked-to-own-a-home-now-shes-struggling-to-keep-it.html", "date": "2018-11-18 00:00:00", "author": "By Remy Tumin", "description": "Elba Roman\u2019s poor health has put her out of work for four years, resulting in a pile of unpaid bills.", "title": "She Worked to Own a Home.

{"content": "GQ did not name Serena Williams its 2018 Woman of the Year on its cover. It named her its 2018 \u201cWoman\u201d of the Year \u2014 and the quotation marks made a troubling difference to her fans. The men\u2019s fashion magazine unveiled the covers of its upcoming issue this week \u2014 one cover for Ms. Williams, three others for GQ\u2019s Men of the Year \u2014 and was immediately denounced on social media. Ms. Williams, one of history\u2019s most accomplished tennis players, has a muscular physique, which she said last year has resulted in people calling her a man or telling her she belongs in men\u2019s sports. Critics said the magazine\u2019s use of quotation marks around \u201cwoman\u201d on Ms. Williams\u2019s cover appeared to call into question her gender or her femininity, a trope with at least a touch of transphobia. \u201cTo everyone saying this is a reach, you have to consider the context of Serena\u2019s career and the way people have mocked and challenged her and Venus\u2019s femininity because of their strength and athleticism,\u201d one Twitter user wrote, referring to her sister, Venus Williams. \u201cIn that context, this was a bad choice.\u201d Another user said GQ should have known better, given the \u201cmisogynistic and violent trans insults that Serena (and Venus) have dealt with for the last almost 20 years.\u201d [Sign up here for Gender Letter, our newsletter that helps you keep up with the world, and the women shaping it.] GQ did not immediately return an email seeking comment. But Mick Rouse, a research manager for the magazine, said on Twitter that there was a perfectly reasonable explanation: The word \u201cwoman\u201d on the cover was handwritten by Virgil Abloh, a celebrated designer who created Ms. Williams\u2019s apparel at this year\u2019s U.S. Open, and who frequently uses quotation marks in his work. Mr. Abloh, a longtime creative director for Kanye West and founder of the streetwear label Off-White, is a familiar name to many of GQ\u2019s fashion-conscious readers. In March, he was named Louis Vuitton\u2019s artistic director of men\u2019s wear. Indeed, the items Ms. Williams wore during the U.S. Open had quotation marks around words like \u201cLOGO\u201d and \u201cSERENA.\u201d But not all of GQ\u2019s readers \u2014 or the countless others who saw the cover in their social media feeds \u2014 were familiar with Mr. Abloh\u2019s designs or his connection to Ms. Williams. To them, it was a conscious punctuation choice. It might have gotten less notice if someone other than Ms. Williams, who has often discussed struggles with sexism, had been the honoree. Last year, in an open letter to her mother, she said she had been called a man \u201cbecause I appeared outwardly strong.\u201d \u201cIt has been said I don\u2019t belong in Women\u2019s sports \u2014 that I belong in Men\u2019s \u2014 because I look stronger than many other women do,\u201d she wrote on Reddit, adding that she works hard and was born with a body she is proud of. Ms. Williams gave birth to a daughter in 2017 and came back in 2018 to make the finals of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, losing both. Her next Grand Slam singles championship would tie the record of 24. Her U.S. Open loss was memorable for a heated argument with the chair umpire that was seen by many as an illustration of common sexism. The umpire gave her a warning for receiving help from a coach in the stands, then assessed a penalty after she slammed her racket and broke it. \u201cThere are men out here that do a lot worse,\u201d she pleaded to the umpire, \u201cbut because I\u2019m a woman, because I\u2019m a woman, you\u2019re going to take this away from me? That is not right.\u201d Billie Jean King, a former top tennis player, supported her at the time, saying Ms. Williams had been subjected to a \u201cdouble standard.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/business/media/serena-williams-gq.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By Daniel Victor", "description": "Some social media users thought the magazine was calling the tennis star\u2019s femininity into question.

{"content": "\u2022 Sigrid Nunez won the fiction prize for \u201cThe Friend.\u201d \u2022 Jeffrey C. Stewart won the prize for nonfiction for his book about the philosopher Alain Locke,  and Justin Phillip Reed\u2019s \u201cIndecency\u201d won the prize for Poetry. \u2022 Yoko Tawada and her translator, Margaret Mitsutani, won the award for Translated Literature for the novel \u201cThe Emissary,\u201d and Elizabeth Acevedo\u2019s \u201cThe Poet X\u201d won for Young People\u2019s Literature. \u2022 Chilean novelist Isabel Allende accepted the foundation\u2019s lifetime achievement award. Sigrid Nunez won the National Book Award for fiction for her novel, \u201cThe Friend,\u201d which centers on a lonely writer who loses her best friend to suicide and finds comfort in caring for his Great Dane. A sometimes acerbic meditation on loss and love, the novel was among this year\u2019s critical favorites \u2014 the Times\u2019 critic Dwight Garner called it \u201cdry, allusive and charming,\u201d noting that when the fragile writer adopts the large, lumbering dog, \u201cthe comedy here writes itself.\u201d \u201cThe Friend\u201d also resonated with critics and judges this year perhaps because of its subtle exploration of sexual harassment: The writer\u2019s deceased friend was a prominent writer who leveraged his fame to have inappropriate relationships with his young students. In their citation, the judges called \u201cThe Friend\u201d an \u201cexquisitely written and deeply humane exploration of grief, literature and memory.\u201d This year\u2019s fiction finalists included an eclectic mix of experimental works from independent publishing houses like Soho Press and Graywolf, and writing by established novelists like Lauren Groff and Rebecca Makkai. Some of the biggest surprises in the fiction category this year involved not the five writers who made the shortlist, but the critical and commercial darlings who were overlooked. Two of this year\u2019s most popular and acclaimed novels, \u201cThere There\u201d by Tommy Orange and \u201cAn American Marriage\u201d by Tayari Jones, were longlisted but failed to make the finalist cut. Nunez, author of the novels \u201cSalvation City,\u201d \u201cThe Last of Her Kind,\u201d \u201cA Feather on the Breath of God\u201d and \u201cFor Rouenna,\u201d among others, spoke in her acceptance speech about how writers are able to find meaning in pain and emotional hardship because suffering and loss can generate great literature. \u201cHowever dreadful, it may be of use,\u201d she said. In \u201cThe New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke,\u201d Stewart drew on vast research into Locke and his contemporaries, Jazz Age luminaries and prominent African-American artists, dancers, dramatists and novelists. In his acceptance speech, Stewart recognized Locke\u2019s struggles as a closeted gay man, noting that he created a community of artists as his family. \u201cIf he was here right now accepting this award, he wouldn\u2019t have family with him, as a gay man who lived a closeted life,\u201d he said. In recent years, the nonfiction category, like everything else in culture these days, has taken on pointed political overtones, populated with books about racism, mass incarceration and the rise of the religious and political right. This year\u2019s finalists were a bit more thematically diverse. In addition to Stewart\u2019s biography of Alain Locke, there was also a biography of the botanist David Hosack (Victoria Johnson\u2019s \u201cAmerican Eden: David Hosack, Botany, and Medicine in the Garden of the Early Republic\u201d) and Adam Winkler\u2019s \u201cWe the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights,\u201d a history of how corporations gained power and influence in the United States, shaping national policies to grant companies rights that are comparable to those of individuals. Some of the nominated books speak to our current politics and the growing cultural, political and class divide between rural and urban America, most notably Sarah Smarsh\u2019s \u201cHeartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth,\u201d which chronicles her childhood in Kansas, where she grew up in a white working-class family, and addresses how poverty can trap people across generations. Justin Phillip Reed\u2019s collection \u201cIndecency,\u201d which grapples with themes of masculinity, sexuality, exploitation and racism, won the prize for poetry. The judges praised the collection as a \u201cformally explosive\u201d work that makes \u201cintimacy both refuge and weapon.\u201d Reed, who was born and raised in South Carolina, has published in the Kenyon Review, the African American Review and elsewhere. \u201cI meditated on the courage it might take to feel worthy of this,\u201d he said as he accepted his award. Among the other poetry finalists were Rae Armantrout\u2019s \u201cWobble,\u201d Terrance Hayes\u2019s \u201cAmerican Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin,\u201d Diana Khoi Nguyen\u2019s \u201cGhost Of\u201d and Jenny Xie\u2019s \u201cEye Level.\u201d This novel, \u201cThe Emissary,\u201d by Yoko Tawada and translated by Margaret Mitsutani, won for translated literature. It is set in near future Japan in a world in which the boundaries between generations blur. Children become infirm while older people become robust. It centers on a boy who lives with his grandfather. The judges\u2019 citation praised the book for being \u201cplayful, powerful and wise,\u201d and for imagining a novel in which \u201cboundaries between species, families and genders blur and reconfigure.\u201d Tawada wasn\u2019t there to receive the award, but sent a statement thanking the National Book Foundation for restoring the prize in translation: \u201cTranslation gives a book wings to fly across national borders,\u201d she wrote. The award for works in translation was added this year, marking the first time in decades that the foundation has recognized literature beyond the borders of the United States. The foundation\u2019s board unanimously voted to add the prize, which is given jointly to authors and translators, and recognizes fiction and nonfiction works by living authors who are published in the United States. (International authors who write in English are not eligible.) \u201cThis is an opportunity for us to influence how visible books in translation are,\u201d Lisa Lucas, the executive director of the National Book Foundation, told The Times when the prize was announced. \u201cThe less we know about the rest of the world, the worse off we are.\u201d The addition of the translation prize marks a departure from the National Book Awards\u2019 original mission of celebrating \u201cThe Best of American Literature,\u201d but many in the literary world have cheered the broadening of the awards as a necessary corrective to the often parochial attitude of American readers and publishers toward works in translation. It also restores a prize that was eliminated in 1986, when the foundation had a slew of categories that it felt diluted the significance of the awards, among them were prizes for books about science, philosophy and religion, history and biography, arts and letters, contemporary thought, autobiography, first novel. By also recognizing translators as co-creators, the awards are highlighting an often overlooked art form. This year\u2019s five finalists included writers and translators from several continents, among them Olga Tokarczuk, \u201cFlights\u201d translated from Polish by Jennifer Croft; N\u00e9gar Djavadi, \u201cDisoriental\u201d, translated from French by Tina Kover, and Hanne \u00d8rstavik, \u201cLove\u201d, translated from Norwegian by Martin Aitken. One of the nominated translators was a well known and celebrated novelist in her own right: the Pulitzer-Prize winning writer Jhumpa Lahiri, who translated the Italian writer Domenico Starnone\u2019s novel \u201cTrick.\u201d Elizabeth Acevedo\u2019s \u201cThe Poet X\u201d, a novel written in verse, about a 15-year-old girl from an observant Dominican family in Harlem who is navigating the perils of adolescence and finding solace in her poetry notebook, won the award for Young People\u2019s Literature. In an emotional acceptance speech, Acevedo thanked her agent and her editor, \u201cwho let me use the language that was authentic to what I needed to say.\u201d She noted that as a Latina author, she often feels an additional burden to prove herself. \u201cI walk through the world with a chip in my shoulder,\u201d she said. \u201cI go into so many spaces where I feel like I have to prove that I\u2019m allowed to be in that place.\u201d She reserved her most heartfelt thanks for her readers, children who approach her and say they\u2019d never seen characters whose lives reflect their own in a book before. In recognizing \u201cThe Poet X,\u201d which blends poetry and prose, the judges highlighted how innovative children\u2019s literature has become. Some of the most groundbreaking authors at work today write for children and young adults, and the scope and depth of contemporary children\u2019s literature was on display in the work of the five finalists. In \u201cThe Assassination of Brangwain Spurge,\u201d M.T. Anderson and Eugene Yelchin adopt a novel story-telling device \u2014 the tale unfolds from two different perspectives of a goblin and an elf, one in prose, and one in illustrations that resemble medieval woodcuts. A critic for The Times called the book \u201cboth moving and hilarious.\u201d The graphic novelist Jarrett J. Krosoczka was nominated for \u201cHey, Kiddo,\u201d a poignant and honest graphic memoir about growing up as the son of a heroin addict. The Chilean novelist Isabel Allende accepted the foundation\u2019s lifetime achievement award for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, becoming the first Spanish-language author to ever receive the prize, which has gone to such influential writers as Stephen King, John Updike, Toni Morrison and Tom Wolfe. Allende became a global literary star when her first novel, \u201cThe House of Spirits,\u201d was published in 1982. She has gone on to write more than 20 works that have collectively sold more than 70 million copies. The novelist Luis Alberto Urrea introduced Ms. Allende, citing her profound influence on him and praising her for writing fearlessly in the face of dictatorships and political oppression. \u201cIn despotic times she speaks of human hope,\u201d he said. \u201cIf dictators like Chile\u2019s Pinochet could not silence these kinds of voices, could not stop the words, then what Isabel does is a calling to us to be bolder.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t build a wall to keep them out. You can\u2019t lock them up,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has taught us that words have wings.\u201d In her speech, Allende said she was accepting the award on \u201cbehalf of millions of people like myself who have come to this country in search of a new life.\u201d She denounced the rise of \u201cnationalism and racism\u201d in our current political discourse, and spoke about the power of literature to forge understanding across cultures and nationalities. \u201cThe values and principles that sustain our civilization are under siege,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we listen to another person\u2019s story, if we tell our own story, we start to heal from division and hatred.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/books/national-book-awards.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By Alexandra Alter", "description": "The judges called the novel an \u201cexquisitely written and deeply humane exploration of grief.\u201d", "title": "Sigrid Nunez Wins 2018 National Book Award for \u2018The Friend\u2019"},
{"content": "MOSCOW \u2014 Pretty much all seasoned travelers know the frustration of flight delays \u2014 the time wasted puttering in an airport, waiting in a hotel room or, perhaps worst of all, stuck on the tarmac in an idled plane. But how about three days stranded in Siberia? That was the nightmare experienced by the passengers and crew of Air France Flight 116 this week, when their Boeing 777 was diverted to the city of Irkutsk on Sunday, about 2,600 miles east of Moscow, after an acrid smell and light smoke wafted through the cabin. The 282 passengers sat on the plane for some six hours before being allowed to disembark. But a chilly reception then awaited \u2014 both literally (at one point it was around 1 degree Fahrenheit, or minus 17 Celsius, outside) and figuratively, with passengers forced to stay within the confines of the airport or two hotels where they were put up because they lacked entry visas. Initially, they were denied access to their luggage as well. To make matters worse, a second Boeing 777 sent from Paris to pick up the passengers, who were traveling from the French capital to Shanghai, also broke down before takeoff in Irkutsk as the hydraulic system froze. That led to another long wait on the tarmac in Siberia, before the passengers were once again told to deplane. \u201cWe are dirty, we smell, it is now over 30 hours that we are under house arrest, without a suitcase or passport,\u201d Eleanor Joulie, one of those stranded, wrote on Twitter on Monday, after the ordeal was barely half over. Finally, a third aircraft flew them to Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Wednesday, according to Air France. Among the travelers stuck in Irkutsk were employees of Louis Vuitton, the luxury goods brand, including several social media managers whose Instagram posts displayed a mixture of frustration and mirth as the misadventure dragged on. They cooled their heels at a London-themed pub in their hotel and posted a six-second video on YouTube pretending to be the opening credits of an imaginary TV series called \u201cStuck in Siberia.\u201d Another passenger, St\u00e9phane Catherine, posted pictures of fellow travelers digging into their stock of luxury macaroons as they waited at the Irkutsk airport. The episode prompted plenty of jokes from Russians on social media, partly because the story echoed the plot of a popular 1970s Soviet comedy called \u201cThe Incredible Adventures of Italians in Russia.\u201d Many also pilloried officials in Irkutsk for not letting the foreigners look around \u2014 Lake Baikal, one of the wonders of Siberia, was only about an hour\u2019s drive away. Others offered to show passengers the sights if they returned under more pleasant circumstances. Air France, in a statement, said it regretted the situation and wished to apologize to passengers \u201cfor the inconvenience and significant delay experienced.\u201d As for any recompense such as vouchers, the airline said it had \u201ccontacted the customers concerned to propose suitable commercial measures.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/world/europe/air-france-flight-siberia.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By Sophia Kishkovsky", "description": "Passengers on an Air France plane that was forced to land at Irkutsk airport in Russia endured a nightmare stay after a replacement plane also developed a fault.", "title": "3 Days Stranded in Siberia?

{"content": "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ American corporations want to kick their reliance on big pharmaceutical companies. Walmart and Home Depot are among the many companies that are fighting back against drugmaker programs that cut patients\u2019 expenses while leaving employers paying full rates. It is part of an escalating war between providers, insurers and corporations over health care costs. The effectiveness remains to be proved. America spends about 18 percent of its gross domestic product, or roughly twice as much as most developed nations, on health care. A large part of that pays for the administrative staff that battle to take dollars from other players and patients, or defend their own pockets. The United States had the highest percentage of health expenditure on insurance and administration, and patient time spent on cost disputes, among 11 industrialized countries, according to a 2014 study by The Commonwealth Fund. Pharmaceuticals, which account for some 10 percent of the U.S. health budget, are a good example of this struggle. To limit what they consider unnecessary drug spending, most insurers require that patients pay a portion of the cost, known as the co-pay, subject to an annual limit. As co-pays have escalated, drugmakers have introduced assistance cards that limit patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs while leaving insurers and employers stuck with the bill. Some of those insurers and employers are now counterattacking with programs called co-pay accumulators and maximizers. By excluding drugmaker payments from annual deductible limits, they leave patients on the hook for a larger share of their drug bill, and encourage them to switch to cheaper alternative medicines. Undoubtedly, pharmaceutical firms will think of a clever retort, given the stakes. Confused? You aren\u2019t alone. Insurers may not tell patients and drugmakers that they have adopted a co-pay accumulator. Add in various discount programs and kickbacks among participants in the drug chain and it\u2019s hard for even well-educated participants to figure out how much a drug will cost a patient. It all resembles \u201cThe Glass Bead Game\u201d by Hermann Hesse. In that book, society\u2019s elite spend a lifetime playing a game whose rules are so vague and sophisticated that outsiders can\u2019t comprehend it. Those that master the game achieve spiritual transcendence. In American health care, the stakes are slightly higher margins. Of course, dedicating so many talented, well-educated Americans to such pursuits is not a good prescription \u2014 for health or happiness.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/business/dealbook/corporations-big-pharma.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By Robert Cyran", "description": "Corporations are adopting new tactics to save money by limiting the use of discount cards on certain medicines.", "title": "U.S. Companies Are Fighting Their Big Pharma Addiction"},

{"content": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 A majority of Sri Lankan lawmakers voted Wednesday morning to remove Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister, saying that his appointment last month was illegal. Mr. Rajapaksa is considered the strongman of Sri Lankan politics, a wealthy, powerful former president who has been accused of grave human rights abuses. The country has been tied in knots since late last month when President Maithripala Sirisena abruptly fired the previous prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and appointed Mr. Rajapaksa to the post. It was a rambunctious, unruly few hours in Parliament this morning. Lawmakers allied with Mr. Wickremesinghe walked into the chamber wearing black sashes that read \u201cFor democracy.\u2019\u2019 The gallery was packed with journalists, diplomats and everyday citizens. Lawmakers allied with Mr. Rajapaksa did whatever they could to block a vote of no confidence. Some yelled, while others tried to grab the ceremonial mace, the parliamentary symbol of power. Some even called the speaker of Parliament a \u201cmad fool.\u201d But a majority of lawmakers were determined to hold the vote. Mr. Rajapaksa then walked out. When the ayes were counted, 122 out of 225 said they wanted Mr. Rajapaksa gone. \u201cThis is a historic day,\u201d a triumphant Mr. Wickremesinghe said. It is unclear what will happen next. Sri Lanka has a slightly unusual leadership structure in which executive powers are vested in both the president and the prime minister. Mr. Sirisena, the president, seems to have backed himself into a corner and miscalculated the intensity of the resistance to his appointment of Mr. Rajapaksa. The prime minister he fired, Mr. Wickremesinghe, was definitely less popular than Mr. Rajapaksa before this crisis started. Many Sri Lankans saw Mr. Wickremesinghe as aloof and ineffective, numb to the economic troubles that have begun to pile up around them as this island nation slides deeper into debt, much of it to China. Mr. Rajapaksa had seemed well entrenched as president until Mr. Sirisena defied the odds and beat him in the 2015 election. Some people were concerned about Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s deals with China; many others were worried about his authoritarian tendencies and intolerance for dissent, including crackdowns on journalists and dissidents. Human rights groups blamed him for the deaths of thousands of civilians killed on his watch by army commanders, who shelled civilian areas at the end of Sri Lanka\u2019s decades-long civil war. Still, many Sri Lankans see Mr. Rajapaksa as a hero for bringing that war to a decisive close. And the economy has worsened since he left office, making his time at the helm seem like brighter days. Analysts say that had Mr. Rajapaksa simply waited and run again in 2020, he probably could have won. It was the backdoor way in which Mr. Sirisena tried to bring Mr. Rajapaksa back into power that incensed so many Sri Lankans, including the majority of Parliament. Mr. Sirisena knew Parliament was against him and ordered it dissolved last week. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court stepped in, setting that decision aside and paving the way for Parliament to reconvene. Now Sri Lanka is waiting to see what the president does next. In an interview, Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s son Namal said that his father would not resign and insisted that the speaker of Parliament, Karu Jayasuriya, had acted out of order in conducting the vote. \u201cIt was unethical,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/world/asia/sri-lanka-parliament-rajapaksa.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By Dharisha Bastians and Jeffrey Gettleman", "description": "Lawmakers passed a raucous no-confidence vote against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, saying he must step down as prime minister.

{"content": "When this year\u2019s Ryder Cup winners reunite for the first time at the final tour stop in Dubai this week, it will be as if the victory party never ended. For many of the golfers, it will be the first time together since Europe posted its sixth straight Ryder Cup win at home by defeating the United States in September at Le Golf National in Paris, where the players showed they got along famously as a team. Tommy Fleetwood pounced on the back of Ian Poulter after the win. Later during the news conference, Fleetwood blew kisses to Francesco Molinari, and the European Tour is now promoting their bromance. The team spirit is sure to continue this week as 10 of the 12 men from Team Europe, including Molinari, Fleetwood, Poulter, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren and Tyrrell Hatton, begin play in the DP World Tour Championship, Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. But they are competitors once again and must find their way back to that mind-set. \u201cWe are all professionals and will be back to business this week,\u201d said Henrik Stenson, who played for Europe at the Ryder Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard to switch back into competitor mode because we are constantly competing with each other. Trash talking is always happening, and I am sure there will be a little of that per the usual this week.\u201d Molinari is at the top of the Race to Dubai standings and is expected to win, more than a million points ahead of Fleetwood, who is in second place. \u201cMy partnership with Tommy was very special in Paris, and it is amazing that we both head into Dubai with a chance to win the Race to Dubai,\u201d Molinari said. \u201cI think after every Ryder Cup we all become even better friends, and we get to know some of the younger guys better. That is definitely one of the keys to the European team\u2019s success in the Ryder Cup that we are year-round friends. \u201cOf course, it is a different experience from a team event, and we will playing as individuals in a stroke play tournament, and it is the season finale. But our friendships off course stay the same, and it will be very nice to see everybody and share the memories of that special week.\u201d Balancing his friendship with competition after the Ryder Cup hasn\u2019t been a challenge. \u201cIt is no different to how it has been in the past after Ryder Cups,\u201d Molinari said. \u201cFriendships are deeper, and the time on tour afterwards is all the more enjoyable for being able to travel with so many good friends. It doesn\u2019t change anything on the course, except perhaps we all have extra respect for each other that we shared such a special experience together.\u201d Noren called the Ryder Cup win \u201can amazing experience in every aspect.\u201d \u201cIt was tough and fun at the same time,\u201d he added, \u201cand we had a great team spirit, which made the win possible. It will be great to be back with the guys in Dubai.\u201d For Hatton, everything is the same. \u201cWe will remain friends, but still battle against each other on the golf course,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was obviously a great experience the Ryder Cup but, as they say, it\u2019s back to reality. Golf is an individual sport most of the time, so it\u2019s back to the day job, back to business.\u201d Dubai is also the end of a long and exhausting tour season. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long year as usual,\u201d Stenson said, \u201cand it will be nice to spend some time at home with the family, so I will be looking forward to that. I was able to get a procedure done on my elbow a couple weeks back and have been recovering from that. It\u2019s not 100 percent yet, but it feels much better than before.\u201d Molinari said that the Ryder Cup win helped sustain him for the rest of the season. \u201cAn amazing week like we had in Paris gives everyone extra confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be able to perform so well under that type of pressure is a really good feeling to take with you. \u201cMind you, I honestly was exhausted after the week, so that takes a bit to recover from after a busy summer. I feel good now, though, and I\u2019m ready for this week. \u201cI am tired but very proud of my year. I don\u2019t think I have taken it all in really as I have been so busy.

{"content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 As a youngster in the Soviet Union, he once won a playwriting prize. And as a politician in Israel, Avigdor Lieberman has shown a flair for the dramatic, time and again bursting onto the stage to snatch some coveted governmental perch, saying something once thought unspeakable, or making a noisy exit. He has resigned on principle more than once, always seeming to land in a better position than the one he quit. Mr. Lieberman\u2019s departure as defense minister on Wednesday, in protest of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s agreement to a cease-fire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, is not likely to follow that pattern. If he is lucky, his quitting to campaign in the coming elections as an angry member of the opposition, rather than as the defense minister who allowed hundreds of rockets to rain down on Israeli civilians, will give his faltering Yisrael Beiteinu party enough electoral oomph to pick up a few more seats in Parliament. If not, it might spell the end of one of the more colorful careers in Israeli politics. Mr. Lieberman, 60, was born in Kishinev, now the capital of Moldova, and emigrated to Israel at 20. A onetime nightclub bouncer, he rose through the ranks to be a top leader of the right-wing Likud party and aide to Mr. Netanyahu before quitting, for the first time, in 1997 over a round of concessions to the Palestinians. He formed Yisrael Beiteinu \u2014 \u201cIsrael is our home\u201d \u2014 as a party for Russian immigrants who favored a hard line in peace talks. He went on to hold, and then noisily quit, jobs as minister of transportation, minister of strategic affairs, deputy prime minister and foreign minister. A proto-nationalist before it came back into vogue, Mr. Lieberman appealed to his fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9s with heavily accented tough talk: toward Egypt (threatening to bomb the Aswan Dam), the Palestinian Authority (threatening to bomb its offices in the West Bank town of Ramallah), and imprisoned terrorists (to drown them in the Dead Sea). He hinted that he might want to execute Arab lawmakers as \u201cterror collaborators.\u201d One threat haunted him: Before becoming defense minister, he boasted that if he were given the job, he would give Ismail Haniya, the Hamas leader, 48 hours to return captive Israeli civilians and the remains of two Israel soldiers, \u201cor you are dead.\u201d Mr. Haniya is still in his job. Mr. Lieberman was not unremittingly hawkish. For many years, he advocated a land swap that would exchange parts of Israel with high concentrations of Arabs for heavily Jewish-populated areas of the West Bank. He also said that he could support a two-state solution, and that he would even be willing to evacuate his own settlement on the West Bank if it were necessary to make peace. He could even be nuanced: He warned against allowing Israel to be turned into a theocracy, and supported a requirement for ultra-Orthodox Jews to serve in the military. But he did not seek to end government\u2019s role in religious affairs \u2014 only to put more moderate rabbis in charge. On the unsavory side, Mr. Lieberman gained a reputation as a bully after he pleaded guilty to beating up a 12-year-old who had beaten up his son. And he struggled to live down persistent allegations of corruption, at one point quitting as foreign minister to stand trial on fraud and breach of trust charges. He was acquitted. Short of prime minister, the defense ministry was said to be his dream job. He took the post in 2016 at a tumultuous moment. Amid a wave of Palestinian knife attacks, Israeli generals had refused to give in to right-wing demands that soldiers shoot first and ask questions later. After a soldier shot a wounded Palestinian assailant in cold blood, the sitting defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, a former army chief of staff, quickly called for the soldier\u2019s court-martial. As populist anger at the generals grew, Mr. Netanyahu wavered. Then, in a surprise move, Mr. Netanyahu, who had been negotiating to form a unity government with the liberal Zionist Union, instead replaced Mr. Yaalon with Mr. Lieberman, taking his governing coalition further to the right. Some expected Mr. Netanyahu to use Mr. Lieberman to rein in the top generals, said Amos Harel, the military analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. But Mr. Lieberman, who had never risen past corporal, was quickly outfoxed by the generals. They proved far more adept at the inside game, saying yes to his directives but rarely following through on them, Mr. Harel said. \u201cThey hugged him, they chewed him up, and they spat him out,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s almost a man who wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Now, with the generation of Russians who powered his rise dying off and their assimilated offspring speaking unaccented Hebrew and voting for other parties, his party is on the decline. It holds just six seats in Parliament, down from a high of 15 in 2009. Opinion polls have indicated that Yisrael Beiteinu might fail to earn enough votes in the next election to retain any seats. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t found any ability to move beyond his Russian base, and his Russian base is shrinking,\u201d said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a political-science professor at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzilya. With Mr. Netanyahu aligned with the generals on Gaza \u2014 wanting a cease-fire, not an escalation \u2014 and repeatedly overruling him, Mr. Lieberman effectively found that he had been reduced to defense minister in name only. He objected to the recent decision to allow fuel into Gaza, and to allowing Qatar to send $15 million in cash to help pay civil servants\u2019 salaries there. Finally, he opposed the cease-fire with Hamas, arguing that it would undermine Israel\u2019s deterrence and endanger its security in the long run. So he quit, with another loud flourish.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/world/middleeast/liebermans-colorful-career-reaches-a-fork-again.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By David M.

{"content": "Nikolas Cruz, the man charged with killing 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in February, faces three new charges of assaulting an officer in jail and grabbing his electroshock weapon, the authorities said on Wednesday. Mr. Cruz, 20, is being held in the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s main jail, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., as he awaits trial on 34 counts of premeditated murder and attempted murder in the shooting on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The new charges relate to a fight with a deputy at the jail on Tuesday, shortly before 6 p.m., the sheriff\u2019s office said in a statement on Wednesday. The deputy, Sgt. Raymond Beltran, told Mr. Cruz to \u201cnot drag his sandals on the ground\u201d in a day room, according to an affidavit. It said Mr. Cruz made an obscene gesture at the sergeant and \u201crushed\u201d him and \u201cstruck him in the face.\u201d The two men ended up on the ground, the affidavit said. Video, which the authorities did not release, shows that Mr. Cruz was on top of Sergeant Beltran at one point, punching him multiple times in the head, according to the affidavit. Mr. Cruz grabbed Sergeant Beltran\u2019s electroshock weapon out of his holster, the video shows. As the two men struggled for control of the weapon, it went off, the affidavit said. Mr. Cruz hit Sergeant Beltran several more times, until the sergeant struck at Mr. Cruz\u2019s face while holding the weapon, according to the affidavit. Mr. Cruz faces charges of assault and battery of an officer, and an obstruction charge related to the struggle for the weapon, the affidavit said. A shackled Mr. Cruz appeared in court on Wednesday to hear the charges of battery and of using an electrical or chemical weapon against a law enforcement officer, The Sun-Sentinel reported. A hearing for the third charge will be on Friday, the newspaper reported. A call to the public defenders\u2019 office, which is representing Mr. Cruz, was not returned. It was not immediately clear whether the sergeant or Mr. Cruz was injured in the encounter. Prosecutors in Florida are seeking the death penalty against Mr. Cruz in the massacre at Stoneman Douglas High, which he carried out with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle when he was 19, the authorities have said. He had announced his goals on three videos recorded on his cellphone before the shooting, saying: \u201cYou\u2019ll all know who I am. You\u2019re all going to die.\u201d Of the 34 counts on which Mr. Cruz has been indicted, 17 are of premeditated murder in the first degree, and 17 are of attempted murder in the first degree. Parents of students killed in the Parkland shooting were angered this week after Mr. Cruz was reported to have registered to vote in the midterm elections from jail \u2014 even though it would not have been illegal for him to vote, The Sun-Sentinel and other news outlets reported. Voting records show that Mr. Cruz registered on July 25 as a Republican. \u201cJust because something is technically legal doesn\u2019t make it just or ethical,\u201d Andrew Pollack, whose 17-year-old daughter, Meadow, was among those killed, wrote on Facebook on Nov. 12. \u201cEveryone knew this notorious killer had just admitted to 17 murders.

{"content": "The DP World Tour Championship, Dubai, tees off on Thursday, as the conclusion of the Race to Dubai ends the European Tour season with its annual showpiece event. Now a decade old, the tournament in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, serves the dual purpose of providing a meaningful competitive conclusion to the European season and, ideally for the organizers, a winner who reflects the dominant story lines of the season. This year, they may get both. The two front-running golfers in the money-earning standings, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, have had a surge of success this year, amplified by performances at the Ryder Cup that created an unlikely double act that has since been called Moliwood. The man who claims to have coined that word, Nathan Homer, is the chief commercial and marketing officer for the European Tour. Before the Ryder Cup, he had a strategic plan to make the most of the additional audience the Ryder Cup always brings, but then everything changed. Molinari and Fleetwood were enjoying career years. Molinari won his first major at the British Open; Fleetwood came within a stroke of winning the United States Open in June. But seeing the longhaired, vivacious Fleetwood paired with the sober Molinari, a winning partnership that led to a runaway European victory in the Ryder Cup, was the kind of odd-couple narrative that Homer and his team knew they could use for the rest of the Race to Dubai \u2014 and beyond. Speaking by phone, Homer characterized the emerging dynamic between the players as a rare gift. \u201cWhen you have a scenario where Frankie and Tommy have that Ryder Cup experience and are also top of the Race to Dubai, of course you\u2019re going to make the most of it,\u201d Homer said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those great moments for sportsmen where they have a week of their lives, and their profile changes totally. The immediate question for us was, how do we use that and keep them burning?\u201d For Homer\u2019s team, the answer meant rapid improvisation. By the Sunday evening of the Ryder Cup victory, with the European party still raging, Fleetwood and Molinari had been spirited away to a hotel room to film a scene for social media showing them waking up in bed with the trophy. By the time they arrived at the British Masters less than two weeks later, spectators were grabbing photo opportunities beside a Moliwood sign. Molinari and Fleetwood were also paired on the course for the opening two rounds of the tournament, as the organizers and the two golfers leaned into the story line. Playing to the cameras before the opening round, the men teased each other about their newfound fame, with Molinari saying, \u201cI might not talk to him and give him a cold shoulder and see how he takes it.\u201d It was a joke that played off a longstanding friendship that predates their recent success. Fleetwood\u2019s wife and manager, Claire Fleetwood, used to manage Molinari, and during their Ryder Cup campaign Tommy Fleetwood would describe Molinari as \u201cone of my best friends, not just on tour, but in life.\u201d As the Dubai event approaches, Homer is working with the tournament sponsors, the shipping company DP World, to produce a promotional event built around Moliwood and the sponsor\u2019s ownership of the ship Queen Elizabeth II. Whatever form that takes, the frothy marketing stunts have a serious intent. Since Keith Pelley, a Canadian media executive, became chief executive of the European Tour in 2015, the organization has retooled for the social media era. When the organizers talk about the selling points of a tour that has historically been financially and culturally secondary to the dominant PGA Tour, they are as likely to invoke the character and social diversity of its global venues and players, as they are its competitive credibility. The popular success of Fleetwood and Molinari represents a rare intersection of both. And in a golf world where the PGA Tour represents the gold standard, Pelley and Homer know that legitimate claims for the European Tour\u2019s viability as a stand-alone circuit needs sustained performances from its elite competitors. \u201cIt starts on the course,\u201d Homer said. Historically, that\u2019s been a tough sell. Despite the vastly improved prize money that the Rolex Series has provided to important events on the European Tour, the top European players still plan their seasons around the PGA Tour. Players have complained about the travel strain of trying to reconcile PGA and European Tour commitments, and Rory McIlroy suggested last year that a world tour could be created by having the PGA Tour buy the European Tour. Even Molinari skipped the French Open, a European Tour event, this year to shore up his FedExCup ranking and help maintain his PGA Tour card, saying on social media at the time that he was sorry, but that \u201cI have to do what I think is right.\u201d Still, Homer is banking on Molinari to help provide another Moliwood narrative, which Homer and Pelley hope will give the European Tour a boost, this time by pitting Europe\u2019s leading Ryder Cup players against each other. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how things are that of all people, he is the one right behind me,\u201d Molinari said of Fleetwood. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a little strange to try and beat each other instead of playing as a team.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/sports/golf/moliwood-tommy-fleetwood-francesco-molinari.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By Graham Parker", "description": "The two golfers, who made a splash at the Ryder Cup and who are now being called Moliwood, may give the tour a boost.", "title": "European Tour Hopes to Build on Fleetwood-Molinari Pairing"},

{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 He has been accused of rigging the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries to thwart Bernie Sanders and facilitating a deluge of big money into politics. He helped arrange financing for the dossier of sometimes salacious and unverified claims about President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia and now is under direct fire from the president, who has said he is trying to steal the Senate race in Florida from the Republican candidate, Gov. Rick Scott. For an election lawyer, Marc E. Elias has drawn unusually intense attention and criticism. But then, Mr. Elias, who is representing Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, in the Florida recount, has been at the center of an unusually large number of high-stakes political fights. His role in the Florida battle, in which Mr. Scott\u2019s lead has shrunk from nearly 60,000 votes at the end of election night to less than 13,000 votes out of more than eight million cast, has thrust him even further onto center stage as the Democrats\u2019 lead lawyer and spokesman, making him a tempting foil for Mr. Trump. Last week, Mr. Trump  called him out by name, referring to \u201cthis guy Elias, who represented Hillary Clinton and a lot of very shady things.\u201d That was an apparent reference to Mr. Elias\u2019s secretly arranging funding from two of his clients \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee \u2014 to compile research that became the dossier about Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. A few hours after his off-handed swipe at Mr. Elias, the president took to Twitter to elaborate, writing, \u201cAs soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don\u2019t worry, Florida \u2014 I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\u201d Mr. Elias is perhaps best known for his role in helping to deliver a handful of previous recounts to Democrats, including in the bitterly fought two-month battle over a Minnesota Senate election in 2008 that brought victory to Al Franken. But he has also worked mostly behind the scenes for the past decade shaping the laws and regulations governing American politics, from voting access to redistricting to campaign fund-raising and spending. The work has yielded tens of millions of dollars in legal fees for his firm, Perkins Coie, from corporations, campaigns and political committees. In the process, Mr. Elias has earned a reputation as one of the most formidable election lawyers in the country, and arguably one of the most influential of unelected Democrats in Washington. He has been a trusted adviser to the party\u2019s most senior leaders in Congress, and is admired by its campaign operatives for his knowledge of the way campaigns work and his willingness to use aggressive, pioneering tactics to help them win elections. That approach, however, has earned him the ire of activists who support increased transparency and decreased money in politics. They say he has been among the biggest impediments to both causes, and has often put the short-term interests of the Democratic Party ahead of the interests of the party\u2019s base, and even of American democracy more broadly. \u201cHe\u2019s doing really important work for voting rights that benefits all voters, but he\u2019s also pushed for a deregulation of money in politics that serves the interests of the wealthy,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, the vice president of policy and litigation for the nonpartisan government watchdog group Common Cause. The group joined with the League of Women Voters, another nonpartisan nonprofit group, to file a lawsuit on Monday seeking to force Governor Scott to recuse himself from overseeing the recount. Mr. Elias approvingly cited the suit during a Monday conference call with reporters. Yet Common Cause and other government-reform groups have consistently opposed Mr. Elias\u2019s efforts to shape campaign finance rules, through legislative maneuvering, Federal Election Commission filings and court cases, to allow his clients to raise more money with fewer restrictions. They objected when he requested exemptions for his clients Google and Facebook from political advertising disclaimer rules in 2010 and 2011, respectively, that some supporters later argued could have helped identify Russian election meddling in 2016. Through filings with the Federal Election Commission, he helped lay the regulatory groundwork for the unlimited-money political committees known as super PACs, then helped clear the way for candidates to help raise money for super PACs, which are barred from coordinating other activities with candidates. He structured an arrangement under which one political outfit he represented that included a super PAC began directly coordinating with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, which was also a client of his. That sparked howls of protest from independent election watchdogs, as did his leading role in writing a provision that was quietly slipped into a 2014 year-end spending bill that allowed national party committees to accept donations of $97,400 per person to fund legal costs associated with recounts like the ones in Florida. His defenders point out that Mr. Elias\u2019s legal work also has placed him at the cutting edge of expanding voting access, including a lawsuit he brought in May on behalf of the League of Women Voters that led a judge to strike down Florida\u2019s ban on early voting sites on college campuses. In some ways, Mr. Elias\u2019s efforts to expand big-money fund-raising and spending undermine his efforts to protect and expand voting access, said Craig Holman, an official at the government watchdog group Public Citizen. \u201cWhile he supports leveling the playing field when it comes to the right to vote, it\u2019s ironic that he opposes any legislation or policies that would level the playing field when it comes to money in politics,\u201d Mr. Holman said. \u201cMarc does not understand that in a world of unlimited and undisclosed money in politics, the Republicans generally hold a strategic advantage.\u201d Right now, though, the Democratic Party\u2019s leadership and base appear united in cheering for Mr. Elias\u2019s aggressive tactics in the Florida recount, and galvanized by Republican attacks on him. In announcing his role leading the recount efforts last week, Mr. Elias declared that \u201cwe believe that at the end of this process, Senator Nelson is going to be declared the winner.\u201d That prompted umbrage on the right, with Governor Scott asserting it proved that Mr. Elias did not care about a fair recount, and was, in fact, \u201chere to steal this election.\u201d The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, one of Mr. Elias\u2019s clients, has gone so far as to send out summaries of the coverage of Mr. Elias\u2019s conference calls with reporters, a treatment more typically reserved for the candidates themselves. Mr. Elias has cast his efforts on the recount as motivated by a desire to ensure that every vote is counted fairly and accurately, and that the recount process is allowed to play out. But after the 2016 North Carolina governor\u2019s election, when Mr. Elias\u2019s Democratic client led by 6,300 votes in an official count that was still ongoing, Mr. Elias called on the Republican candidate to \u201cgraciously concede\u201d rather than waste taxpayer money by calling for a recount. \u201cMarc is a very smart campaign finance and election lawyer, but his legal positions are usually designed to serve the best interests of his Democratic Party clients in winning elections rather than any particular legal principle,\u201d said Jason Torchinsky, a Republican election lawyer who has worked against Mr. Elias in several recounts, including in Florida. Mr. Elias did not respond to requests to be interviewed. A fast-talking native of Rockland County, N.Y., Mr. Elias, 49, joined the Washington office of Perkins Coie shortly after graduating from the Duke University Law School in 1993. He rose through the ranks to become a partner, joining with the head of the firm\u2019s political practice, Robert F. Bauer, to build Perkins Coie into the dominant Democratic firm in the lucrative election law industry. When Mr. Bauer stepped down to become White House counsel under President Barack Obama, Mr. Elias took over as chairman of the practice. He expanded its dominance and reach, adding voter protection groups and super PACs to a portfolio of clients that now includes most of the party\u2019s members of Congress and all its national committees. The firm has been paid nearly $80 million since 2001 by federal candidates and committees, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Those fees, which do not include the millions more paid by nonprofit groups represented by Mr. Elias, are most likely rising further with the Florida recount, in which several of his clients are active. He brought a team from Perkins Coie with him to Orlando, where its members set up a command center in the building that housed Mr. Nelson\u2019s campaign headquarters, though the team has since moved to another building. They have filed lawsuits on behalf of several clients, including the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which sued to extend the deadline for mailed-in ballots to be counted. And Mr. Elias filed suit on behalf of the Nelson campaign challenging the state\u2019s ballot signature-validation process as unconstitutional. On Twitter, where Mr. Elias is an active and combative presence, he urged lawyers to sign up to oversee the ballot recounting process around the state through a nonprofit group called We the Action, for which he serves as chairman of the board. \u201cElias is a really sharp, credible attorney,\u201d said Jon Soltz, a co-founder of VoteVets, another group that signed on to one of his lawsuits in Florida. \u201cIf you\u2019re credible and you\u2019re dangerous to the president, his playbook is to attack. So Marc Elias should wear this as a badge of honor that he\u2019s being effective.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/politics/florida-governor-recount.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By Kenneth P.

{"content": "She has gone from starting-lineup centerpiece to second-half substitute. She still wears the No. 10 but has been asked to reinvent herself as a No. 9. At 36, Carli Lloyd has kept a positive outlook, a level of professionalism and, perhaps most important, a presence on the score sheet as her role with the United States women\u2019s national team has gradually diminished in the past two years. But as she sat pondering her situation last Friday in the lobby of her team\u2019s hotel in Lisbon \u2014 one day after appearing as a reserve in the United States\u2019 1-0 victory over Portugal, and only seven months before the start of another Women\u2019s World Cup \u2014 Lloyd said she needed to make one thing clear. \u201cI think there would be something wrong if I were satisfied and saying, \u2018I\u2019m O.K. with coming off the bench,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be flat-out honest: I\u2019m not O.K. with coming out. I don\u2019t think anybody should be O.K. with coming off the bench. I\u2019m going to fight and push my teammates and try to help in any way possible.\u201d She paused, then added: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that can change in seven months.\u201d In seven months, Lloyd should be headed to France to help the United States try to defend its Women\u2019s World Cup title. All signs, so far, indicate Lloyd, the tournament\u2019s best player in 2015, will make the trip as a supporting player. She has appeared 19 times for the national team this year, but has started only five of those games, most recently in Tuesday\u2019s 1-0 victory at Scotland. Increasingly, she has been used as a target striker, a No. 9 in soccer parlance, rather than in her preferred central midfield position as an instigator, a creator, a No. 10. Her tally of seven goals for the United States is tied for second-most on the team in 2018, but the squad is stacked up front. That has left Lloyd, a two-time world player of the year, looking up on the depth chart. That is not a position she enjoys, or accepts, but for the moment it is the only one Coach Jill Ellis is offering. To those who support Ellis\u2019s effort to invigorate the United States team in the run-up to France, it is also a decision that has some merit. Even Lloyd acknowledged she was surprised to have won her second world player of the year trophy in 2016, only months after the United States team\u2019s crushing elimination in the Olympic quarterfinals in Brazil. When she was named a finalist again a year later, after a pedestrian year in which her diminishing role was apparent to regular followers of the women\u2019s game, only criticism of FIFA\u2019s voting system obscured the increasingly caustic critiques of Lloyd\u2019s performances. Another year later, and with Lindsey Horan, Julie Ertz and Rose Lavelle \u2014 each at least a decade younger than Lloyd \u2014 having locked down roles in Ellis\u2019s midfield, Lloyd has been left to try to capitalize on spare minutes as a goal-poaching substitute. Still, Lloyd\u2019s status has not been a story about a disgruntled old hand resisting change, bristling against reality. Her teammates last week praised her work ethic, and Lloyd herself said that the \u201ctime when every athlete has to hang up the boots\u201d was approaching. But hers isn\u2019t a story about a veteran player happily easing into a diminished role, either. She wants more minutes. She wants to win back a starting job. She wants to write her own ending. \u201cI think I\u2019m as fit as I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d she said, \u201cand to be honest, I feel as if I\u2019m sort of in my prime.\u201d Lloyd was awarded the Golden Ball at the 2015 World Cup after scoring six goals, including a hat trick in the final. That year and the next, FIFA named her the world\u2019s top player. She was among the biggest names in women\u2019s soccer. Yet that whole time, Lloyd said, she was already making subtle preparations for the years to come. She arranged a transfer to Manchester City in England, to test herself against top European competition, and then requested a trade to New Jersey\u2019s Sky Blue F.C. in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, which allowed her to be closer to home, to her husband and to her trainer, James Galanis. And she went to work trying to remake herself into the kind of player Ellis could not justify leaving on the bench. Lloyd pored over video of her on-field movements with Galanis, her personal coach for almost two decades, who kept reiterating that the fastest player on the field was not the one who runs the fastest but thinks the fastest. They reduced their normal skill drills and focused solely on finishing. In an interview, Galanis mused that any perceived drop-off in her performance could be attributable to this tinkering, and he was optimistic Lloyd could again crack Ellis\u2019s starting 11. \u201cWe hope that as we get closer she\u2019s given chances to show that she hasn\u2019t slowed down,\u201d he said. \u201cI took apart my game and changed a lot of things,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cI used to be a player who got the ball and it was Point A to B, get to the goal. Now it\u2019s about being more sophisticated, putting the brakes on, having my game be unpredictable.\u201d Ellis said Lloyd\u2019s situation was similar in ways to the one she handled four years ago with Abby Wambach, another aging star who had to learn to come off the bench. But Ellis said her approach to the individual players, at least so far, has been different. \u201cWith Abby, it was a very early conversation of, \u2018Hey listen, we need you, we value you, whether you\u2019re coming off the bench, starting, are you O.K. with that role?\u2019\u201d Ellis said. \u201cAnd Abby was fantastic.\u201d The private discussions about Lloyd\u2019s transition, Ellis said, have been more open-ended. \u201cIt\u2019s just, \u2018Let\u2019s see where we are and how this plays out,\u2019\u201d Ellis said. Lloyd has not been publicly critical of her demotion, and she said she appreciated Ellis\u2019s openness throughout the process. \u201cWe\u2019ve had conversations,\u201d Lloyd said, \u201cbut I\u2019m the type of player that, if somebody is going to tell me I can\u2019t do something, I\u2019m not good enough, that\u2019s O.K. You can have your opinion, but I\u2019m going to fight till the end.\u201d As a midfielder, Lloyd always had a knack for scoring, even as she covered much more of the field. Now Ellis would like her to focus on that completely, utilizing her powerful shot, her strong aerial game and her innate cunning to fill the next year with goals. \u201cIf you tell her that, \u2018O.K., you need to score more goals,\u2019 she\u2019s going to score more goals,\u201d the veteran defender Becky Sauerbrunn said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to do whatever it takes, and she\u2019s going to have a chip on her shoulder.\u201d But she also offers something that her younger teammates do not: a deep reserve of big-game experience. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like there\u2019s all these different parts of the game \u2014 tactical, technical, blah, blah, blah \u2014 and then there\u2019s just the \u2018moments\u2019 part, where you have to win or lose games, where you need people to step up,\u201d Lloyd\u2019s longtime teammate Megan Rapinoe said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s always been that person.\u201d Still, as she fights to remain relevant, Lloyd, a player responsible for so many big moments, has been trying to focus on the small ones, too. \u201cAs you get older you get a little freaked out, and you want your life to slow down a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cThis final year or two, I want to live a little more in the present and enjoy each day and enjoy time with my friends and family and husband, and here with the team just enjoy the moment, whether the journey is easy or hard, savoring each day.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/sports/soccer/uswnt-carli-lloyd-jill-ellis.html", "date": "2018-11-13 00:00:00", "author": "By Andrew Keh", "description": "The Women\u2019s World Cup kicks off in June, and Carli Lloyd, 36, is focused on playing her way back into the U.S. starting lineup. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that can change in seven months,\u201d she said.", "title": "Carli Lloyd Doesn\u2019t Like the View From the Bench"},
{"content": "Calgary\u2019s hopes of hosting the 2026 Winter Olympics were dashed on Tuesday after citizens voted resoundingly against the western Canadian city\u2019s plan to bid for the Games. More than 56 percent of voters voted against the proposal, a surprisingly lopsided margin after both sides had expected a close call in the city which hosted the 1988 Winter Games. After witnessing a high turnout, with more than 304,000 ballots cast in a reflection of the interest in the poll, the unofficial results had 132,832 opting \u2018For\u2019 and 171,750 \u2018Against\u2019 Calgary making a bid to host the Games. The outcome was another blow for the International Olympic Committee, which has seen interest in hosting Games fall significantly as the size and cost of staging the event has skyrocketed. The Calgary vote leaves Sweden\u2019s Stockholm and an Italian bid involving Milan and Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo as the only candidates left. Swiss city Sion, Japan\u2019s Sapporo and Graz in Austria all withdrew earlier this year, while Turkey\u2019s Erzurum was last month eliminated from the bidding process by the IOC, which will elect the winning bid in June 2019. \u201cIt comes as no surprise following the political discussions and uncertainties right up until the last few days,\u201d the I.O.C. said in a statement. \u201cWe understand the disappointment of all those involved in the candidacywho fought so hard for the Olympic project. \u201cIt is disappointing that the arguments about the sporting, social and long-term benefits of hosting the Olympic Games did not sway the vote. \u201cWe will continue our cooperation with Milan/Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo and Stockholm in order to ensure the best possible host for the Olympic Winter Games 2026.\u201d While the Calgary vote was nonbinding, the 15-member city council is expected to respect the outcome when it meets on Monday to decide whether to move the bid process forward. Calgary 2026 and Canada Olympic Committee acknowledged the people had spoken, with the former saying it would wrap up operations in the next few weeks. \u201cWe know that this was very divisive, but it\u2019s time to put that behind us,\u201d the Calgary bid chief Mary Moran told supporters. \u201cThis all began with great promise: a chance to bring the Olympics and Paralympics home to Calgary and Canada. \u201cA chance to re-establish our city on the world stage \u2014 put us back on the map. It all made sense, and it still makes sense.\u201d The Calgary 2026 Bid Corporation spent a reported $7.56 million on the campaign for a yes vote but could not overcome a low budget grass roots effort to stop the bid. With high unemployment and an oil boom gone bust, residents were anxious about the cost of hosting the Games which the Calgary 2026 Olympic bid corporation estimated at $5.1 billion in Canadian dollars. Calgary has some 85 percent of venues in place, but opponents have argued that the cost far exceed the benefits the Games might bring. \u201cI think that people had enough of the establishment, telling us what to do, what to think,\u201d Sean Chu, a city councilor, said. \u201cThey tell you to spend millions, billions, it\u2019s good for you.\u201d The Canadian Olympic Committee, meanwhile, said the vote represented a missed \u201cunique opportunity\u201d to bring a renewed vision to the Games. \u201cThe Canadian Olympic Committee respects the results of tonight\u2019s plebiscite in Calgary, but we are disappointed with the outcome,\u201d the organization said in the statement. \u201cThe opportunity to welcome the world to Canada, where people can experience the uniting power of the Games and within our nation\u2019s culture of peace and inclusion, would have offered countless benefits to all.\u201d Beijing is hosting the next Winter Games in 2022.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/sports/olympics/calgary-votes-against-hosting-winter-olympics-in-2026.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By Reuters", "description": "More than 56 percent of voters said \u2018No\u2019 in the plebiscite, a surprisingly lopsided margin after both sides had expected a close call.", "title": "Calgary Votes Against Hosting Winter Olympics in 2026"},

El juicio de m\u00e1xima seguridad contra el narcotraficante mexicano Joaqu\u00edn \u201cel Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n comenz\u00f3 el martes y la defensa afirm\u00f3 que el verdadero l\u00edder del C\u00e1rtel de Sinaloa era Ismael \u201cel Mayo\u201d Zambada, quien supuestamente hab\u00eda sobornado con millones de d\u00f3lares a Felipe Calder\u00f3n, expresidente de M\u00e9xico, y a Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, actual mandatario, con el fin de evitar su captura. \u201cEl mundo se est\u00e1 enfocando en el personaje m\u00edtico del Chapo\u201d, coment\u00f3 el abogado Jeffrey Lichtman. \u201cPero nadie est\u00e1 poni\u00e9ndole atenci\u00f3n al Mayo Zambada\u201d.

Por su parte, el fiscal federal Adam Fels le dijo al jurado que las pruebas demostrar\u00edan que Guzm\u00e1n no solo era el l\u00edder del c\u00e1rtel, sino el mayor narcotraficante del mundo. El fiscal afirm\u00f3 que las autoridades estadounidenses han incautado m\u00e1s de 40 toneladas de coca\u00edna pertenecientes a la organizaci\u00f3n de Guzm\u00e1n, quien durante su larga carrera estableci\u00f3 una n\u00f3mina de funcionarios corruptos y un violento ej\u00e9rcito de sicarios para proteger su imperio multimillonario. \u201cEl dinero, las drogas, los asesinatos, una vasta organizaci\u00f3n mundial de narcotr\u00e1fico\u201d, le dijo Fels al jurado. \u201cDe eso se trata este caso\u201d. \u2022 Iv\u00e1n Duque pide fortalecer la Corte Penal Internacional para investigar a Venezuela.

{"content": "MIAMI \u2014 It was only a week ago that Rick Scott, the Republican governor of Florida and candidate for the United States Senate, claimed on television that \u201crampant fraud\u201d was perhaps imperiling his election to Congress, and that he was asking the state Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. Earlier in the day, at the Georgia State Capitol, Secretary of State Brian Kemp defended his decision to oversee an acrimonious election in which he was a candidate for governor and, by his own preliminary assessment, a victorious one. The elections in the Southeast\u2019s two most populous states remained undecided Wednesday, more than a week after the balloting, embroiled in lawsuits and accusations. Much of the turmoil is attributable to the high-profile political prizes at stake. But some can be traced to decisions by Mr. Scott and Mr. Kemp to mix, by design or duty, their public roles with their political lives. That two powerful Republicans helped to oversee elections in which they had overwhelming personal interests prompted bipartisan misgivings, fueled some of the sparring that has spilled into the courts and intensified the most stinging criticisms of their campaigns. Their approaches to navigating the thicket of runoffs and recounts, litigation and delayed certifications, show that there is no set playbook for candidates whose political fates are up for grabs. \u201cThe worst thing you can do is try to force a resolution politically rather than electorally,\u201d said Adam Goodman, a Republican political consultant who advised then-Secretary of State Katherine Harris during the Florida presidential recount in 2000. \u201cThose who are throwing politicized brickbats into the process are doing it \u2014 and every voter \u2014 a disservice.\u201d By the time Mr. Kemp, Mr. Scott and their states entered the messy aftermath of Election Day, both men had been at the centers of two of the year\u2019s most expensive and acrimonious campaigns. In Georgia, Mr. Kemp was seeking to extend the Republican Party\u2019s 16-year grip on power by defeating Stacey Abrams, his Democratic rival who was running to become the first black woman to be elected governor of any state. In Florida, where Mr. Scott\u2019s eight years in power were rapidly drawing to a close, the governor mounted a vigorous campaign to unseat Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat and a wily survivor of his state\u2019s unpredictable political landscape. Both Mr. Scott and Mr. Kemp have insisted they have taken strong lines to assure the lawful conduct of elections in their state not as politicians, but in their roles as elected officials. \u201cOur campaign has filed lawsuits to make sure that Florida law (which is designed to protect against fraud) is followed,\u201d a spokesman for Mr. Scott\u2019s campaign, Chris Hartline, said in a statement. Mr. Kemp went so far as to resign as secretary of state \u2014 but only after the election, when he believed he had all-but-secured the governorship. The race for governor in Florida was bitter from the beginning, but it was not until last Thursday, with his lead over Mr. Nelson dwindling, that Mr. Scott adopted a tone that began raising alarm bells in Democratic circles. After months of campaigning in relatively measured tones, he leveled a series of accusations that implied his opponents had been engaged in fraudulent manipulation of the results. \u201cEvery day since the election, the left-wing activists in Broward County have been coming up with more and more ballots out of nowhere,\u201d he said, without providing any evidence. \u201cWe all know what is going on. Every person in Florida knows exactly what is happening.\u201d Mr. Scott\u2019s hard-line diatribe helped stir protests and trigger a series of Twitter outbursts from President Trump echoing the conspiracy theme. But what raised the most objections from Mr. Scott\u2019s critics was his request two days after the election for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections supervisors in Broward and Palm Beach counties, both elected Democrats. He did not instruct the department to act \u2014 he was speaking as a candidate, not as governor, and the department does not report to him alone \u2014 but the request brought strong criticism from Democrats, who accused Mr. Scott attempting to improperly interfere with the conduct of the vote-count. \u201cHe\u2019s now taking a page from the playbook of the secretary of state of Georgia in an attempt to influence his own election,\u201d Commissioner Steve Geller of Broward County, a Democrat, said in a reference to Mr. Kemp. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the governor of the state and you say without evidence that there\u2019s fraud and you demand that the state agency investigate, it\u2019s just way out of bounds.\u201d The department declined to investigate immediately because no specific instance of possible fraud had been submitted, but said it would look into it if that changed. More controversy arose when the Department of State revealed late Tuesday that it had asked federal prosecutors during election week to investigate whether the Florida Democratic Party had broken the law by sending voters \u2014 apparently most of them Democrats \u2014 incorrect information about how long they would have to resolve invalidated signatures on their mailed-in ballots. In any case, by Wednesday, the governor was decidedly quieter. On a conference call with a federal judge, a lawyer for Mr. Scott said the governor had decided to recuse himself from the state canvassing board that is scheduled to certify the election results on Tuesday. The League of Women Voters, which sued Mr. Scott to force him to step aside from any matters involving the recount, insisted it wanted a neutral outsider appointed instead. In Georgia, meanwhile, controversy surrounded Mr. Kemp and his role in the election as both gubernatorial candidate and secretary of state even before the polls opened. Republicans had championed Mr. Kemp as an enforcer of Georgia elections procedures \u2014 he oversaw purges of the voting rolls and supported a tightening of registration rules \u2014 but Democrats argued that he was rigging the system to his and his party\u2019s benefit. \u201cI certainly wasn\u2019t going to run from my job of making Georgia the most secure, accessible, fair state in the country for elections, and we have done our part to make elections more accessible,\u201d Mr. Kemp said last week. It was only then, once he was asserting himself as the governor-elect, that he announced his resignation. By then, Democrats had long been leveling a barrage of criticism over his dual role. Their outrage has not abated. \u201cWe believe that Brian Kemp mismanaged this election to sway it in his favor,\u201d Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, said on Wednesday. She described Mr. Kemp as \u201cthe secretary of suppression.\u201d Mr. Kemp\u2019s campaign rejected any such assertion and said that Ms. Abrams would \u201cstop at nothing to undermine democracy and attempt to steal this election.\u201d Both Mr. Kemp and Mr. Scott still hold narrow leads, but the controversy that has swirled in the aftermath of both elections highlights how little public consensus there is about what, or how much, a candidate who already holds public office should say when an election is in dispute. Many political strategists, indeed, have doubts about whether such public statements in the aftermath of voting are even useful. Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, suggested that any public posturing by political campaigns had only limited influence. \u201cThe most important decisions, I think, are the legal decisions,\u201d Mr. Lieberman said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what effect, if any, on the outcome of this recount that candidates speaking out will have, but it probably will affect the spirit of their supporters.\u201d Marc Racicot, who was the Republican governor of Montana who spoke frequently on behalf of the George W. Bush campaign during Florida\u2019s notorious 2000 recount, said he urged candidates to remember that their words during election season would be remembered during their subsequent years as lawmakers. \u201cI\u2019d try to advise all of them, Republican or Democrat, to stay focused on the kinds of things you want to exhibit if you\u2019re ultimately chosen as the candidate to become the officeholder,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everyone starts undermining confidence in government from the very beginning, it doesn\u2019t serve us well in the short-run or the long-run.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/florida-georgia-scott-kemp.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By Patricia Mazzei and Alan Blinder", "description": "Brian Kemp and Rick Scott have drawn criticism for mixing their political lives with their public roles, contributing to the electoral turmoil in Georgia and Florida.", "title": "What Happens When Politicians Who Oversee Elections Are Also the Candidates?"},

Location: Highgate village, London His Favorite Room: Mr. Schott lives with his wife in the top half of a townhouse built around 1790 in the Georgian style, which he calls \u201cthe most humane scale of architecture.\u201d The home features a sitting room with volumes of the Oxford English Dictionary and odd curios like a phrenology model head. \u201cPeople walk in and say, \u2018Of course, this is your apartment,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schott said. What\u2019s the definition of a sitting room, exactly? In England, there\u2019s almost a class distinction between what people call a sitting room, a living room and a lounge. They\u2019re all the same room. This is where I relax, entertain, listen to music. It\u2019s where I do most of my reading. With the leather sofa and the globe, the room feels very clubby. I love gentlemen\u2019s clubs. The British version. Not what you consider a gentlemen\u2019s club in America. There\u2019s the fire and a place for your drink. It\u2019s a cocoon. Also, I\u2019m a big believer that you should furnish a room in the architecture style of the building you\u2019re in. I kind of created a mini club in my apartment. Are those proper sitting room pants you\u2019re wearing? You could wear them in a club. These are from Topolina, in Marrakesh. It\u2019s like a Marrakesh Pucci. It\u2019s a stunning shop. You look at them and you\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s from Topolina.\u201d Did you pick up the phrenology head while researching one of your books? It\u2019s been with me for years. It has two meanings. First, it\u2019s about taxonomy and organization of knowledge, one of my great fascinations. The other is I come from a family of medics. I find it amusing to have something that\u2019s completely unscientific, to remind myself I\u2019m the black sheep of the family and not a scientist. And why the wooden dodo bird? It\u2019s papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. I commissioned it from an artist named David Farrer. It\u2019s covered in pages from foreign editions of \u201cSchott\u2019s Original Miscellany.\" I gave him copies and he made a dodo. Partly because writing a book seems to be an incredibly extinct activity. I can picture you in here poring over the O.E.D., drinking a brandy by the fireplace. Does it work? Yes. What is now a modern perk was how you heated your house in this period. There\u2019s an old British saying: You had to know someone seven years before you could touch their fire. It\u2019s a true sign of friendship. Do you feel comfortable touching someone\u2019s log?

{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans elected Representative Kevin McCarthy of California to be their leader on Wednesday, embracing continuity of leadership despite steep losses in last week\u2019s midterm elections that cost the party a majority for the first time in eight years. Mr. McCarthy, the current majority leader and No. 2 Republican in the chamber, will replace Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is retiring at the end of the year. He is tasked in the months ahead with charting the party\u2019s path back to the majority in 2020. And more immediately, he will oversee Republicans\u2019 efforts to protect President Trump from the expected onslaught of oversight, investigations and even a potential impeachment by newly empowered House Democrats. In remarks after the secret-ballot vote, Mr. McCarthy, 53, sought to project Republican unity, pledged to \u201cwin back the suburban areas\u201d that helped cost the party the majority, and said he would be willing to work with Democrats \u2014 up to a point. \u201cWe will work with anybody across that aisle if they work to move America forward,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let me be very clear: If their agenda is simply investigations, impeachment and not focused on the hard-working American public, we will be there to defend the American public.\u201d Mr. McCarthy, whose fund-raising prowess and encyclopedic political knowledge have won him deep relationships within the conference, easily beat back a challenge from Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, 159 to 43. Mr. Jordan, one of the founders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, argued that Republicans lost control of the House because they were insufficiently conservative. He advocated an abrupt break from past leaders. But at a time when Republicans find themselves divided over how to protect their legislative accomplishments and rebuild a stable majority, Mr. McCarthy pitched himself as the only candidate capable of unifying the party. It certainly did not hurt that Mr. McCarthy has cultivated a close relationship Mr. Trump, who once affectionately referred to the Californian as \u201cmy Kevin.\u201d On Wednesday, he rejected a suggestion that Mr. Trump cost Republicans the majority, but acknowledged Republicans needed to make changes. \u201cWe took a beating inside the suburban areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work harder. I think our message is going to have to be clearer. Our ideas are going to have to be stronger.\u201d The fate of the Freedom Caucus \u2014 which wielded considerable influence while Republicans were in power, often to the annoyance of party leaders \u2014 was also in doubt. Without a foothold in the top leadership, their leverage appears destined to dissipate. \u201cI think it is important to have a debate, and that debate happened and was done in a very gentlemanly like fashion,\u201d said Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a close ally of Mr. Jordan. \u201cNow we have to work together going forward.\u201d House Democrats will not hold their leadership elections until later this month. Republicans chose Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana to serve as their whip, the No. 2 position when the party does not hold the House majority. Mr. Scalise was grievously wounded last year when a gunman opened fire on a Republican congressional baseball team practice. The bullets nearly took his life, but he has re-emerged as a force among House Republicans; one of the conference\u2019s most popular figures, he is seen as a potential successor to Mr. McCarthy. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the daughter of former Vice President Richard Cheney first elected to the House in 2016, will lead the Republican conference, the No. 3 position and a potential springboard into the upper echelons of Republican politics. In the Senate, Republicans chose Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as majority leader for another term, his seventh as the Republican leader, in a contest free of any suspense. Senator John Thune of South Dakota will serve as Mr. McConnell\u2019s No. 2, filling the spot vacated by Senator John Cornyn of Texas because of term limits. Republicans also added a woman to a previously all-male leadership team for the first time in a handful of terms: Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will serve as vice chairwoman of the Republican conference, the No. 5 position. And after an election cycle in which they were able to limit losses on a deeply unfavorable map, Senate Democrats chose to keep intact their entire leadership team, led by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. For House Democrats, the picture is more murky. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California is trying to extend her 16-year run as the party\u2019s leader and secure a second stint at speaker. But a cadre of newly elected lawmakers and critics already in office believe they will have the necessary votes to deny her the speakership. They argue that the voters who pushed them into office want to see new blood atop the caucus, and warn that continued leadership by Ms. Pelosi and her lieutenants could deeply damage the party\u2019s brand.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/politics/house-republican-leaders-kevin-mccarthy.html", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "author": "By Nicholas Fandos", "description": "Kevin McCarthy, a California lawmaker and the party\u2019s No. 2 in the chamber, will replace Paul D.

{"content": "Long before John D. Maguire was a civil rights activist, and long before he developed some of the most inclusive college admissions standards of his day, he grew up in the segregated South with views on race that were far from enlightened. \u201cWe drove through the black side of town throwing pears at black guys and yelling racial epithets,\u201d he said in an interview with the University of Southern California in 2014. \u201cWe were the white oppressors. I was the white oppressor.\u201d His awakening began in 1948, when he was chosen by the YMCA to attend a national baseball camp at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The camp was integrated, and each attendee roomed with someone of a different race. On one hot day several of the players, black and white, shared three Dr Peppers. It was, he said, \u201cthe first time I\u2019d ever passed my lips to anything that had touched a black man\u2019s lips.\u201d Several years later, while he was a student at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., he attended a conference at Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pa., where he met and roomed with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. Maguire and Dr. King became friends and colleagues in the years that followed, and the experience informed Dr. Maguire\u2019s vision when he became president of the State University of New York\u2019s College at Old Westbury, on Long Island. Dr. Maguire, who was one of the first college educators in the United States to successfully use diversity as a guiding principle in student admissions, died on Oct. 26 at a care facility in Pomona, Calif. He was 86. His daughter Catherine Maguire said he died after a stroke. Dr. Maguire was a faculty member at Wesleyan University in Connecticut in 1961 when he joined Dr. King on a Freedom Ride through the South. He was arrested and jailed after trying to integrate a bus station lunch counter in Montgomery, Ala. After Dr. King\u2019s assassination, Dr. Maguire was on the first board of directors of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta. In 1970, Dr. Maguire became president of SUNY Old Westbury, a college that had opened two years earlier with the intention of serving populations historically overlooked by institutions of higher education, like minorities, older people and poorer students. The school did not succeed until Dr. Maguire\u2019s tenure began. The first president, the civil rights leader Harris Wofford, envisioned a college where students, faculty members and administrators would govern by consensus \u2014 a radically democratic idea that quickly proved impracticable. (Mr. Wofford went on to greater success as president of Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania and a Democratic United States senator from that state.) After Dr. Maguire installed a more traditional leadership system, he set out to create a student population that was about 30 percent Caucasian, 30 percent African-American, 30 percent Latino and 10 percent other races and ethnicities. A year into his tenure, The Times reported that more than half of Old Westbury\u2019s 610 students were from minority groups. Over the next decade Dr. Maguire increased Old Westbury\u2019s enrollment to more than 3,000 students and offered classes from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., making it easier for students to attend while working full time. He left Old Westbury in 1981 to become president of Claremont Graduate University in California, but Old Westbury continued to follow his example. Michael Kinane, the college\u2019s chief communications officer, said that in 2017 the student body was 32 percent white, 27 percent black, 25 percent Latino and 16 percent from other backgrounds. The Rev. Dr. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and Old Westbury\u2019s president since 1999, said in a telephone interview that Dr. Maguire \u201claid a lasting foundation on which I stand today.\u201d John David Maguire was born on Aug. 7, 1932, in Montgomery to John Henry Maguire, a Baptist preacher, and Clyde (Merrill) Maguire, a writer and homemaker. He grew up in Montgomery and in Jacksonville, Fla., where his father led the expansion of the Florida Baptist Convention over two decades. Dr. Maguire described his parents as \u201cradical segregationists,\u201d although he said they did not see themselves as bigots. His father did not initially welcome his son\u2019s newfound tolerance, and for a time they lost touch. Dr. Maguire played football in high school and at Washington and Lee and graduated from there in 1953. That year he married Billie Parrish, and she soon accompanied him to Scotland on a Fulbright scholarship. He earned a divinity degree from Yale University in 1956 and a doctorate in 1960 before joining the Wesleyan faculty. At Claremont Graduate University, part of the Claremont College consortium, Dr. Maguire opened centers dedicated to the humanities, education, politics, economics and organizational and behavior studies. He retired in 1998. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife; two other daughters, Mary Maguire and Anne Turner; a sister, Martha Worsley; and four grandchildren. Dr. Maguire described his educational philosophy in a convocation address at Old Westbury in 1980. \u201cThe most effective as well as the most demanding way for a college to educate about power and justice as well as truth,\u201d he said, \u201cis by example.\u201d That speech is now assigned in freshman classes that fulfill a diversity education requirement at Old Westbury.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/obituaries/john-d-maguire-dead.html", "date": "2018-11-09 00:00:00", "author": "By Daniel E.

{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Top congressional Democrats demanded on Sunday that President Trump\u2019s acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, recuse himself from overseeing the special counsel investigation, and vowed to use their newfound powers as the incoming House majority to block him from interfering with it. The incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, vowed to make Mr. Whitaker the panel\u2019s first witness when the new Congress convenes in January \u2014 and subpoena him if necessary. The incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Democrats would investigate Mr. Whitaker, a Trump loyalist who has repeatedly and explicitly criticized the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. \u201cThe questions we will ask him will be about his expressed hostility to the investigation, and how he can possibly supervise it when he\u2019s expressed, when he\u2019s come out and said the investigation is invalid,\u201d Mr. Nadler said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, warned that if Mr. Whitaker did not step aside, Democrats would attach legislation protecting the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to a must-pass spending bill. But Mr. Schumer stopped short of saying that Democrats would shut down the government if such legislation did not pass. \u201cThe appointment of Mr. Whitaker should concern every American,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on  \u201cState of the Union,\u201d adding that if Mr. Whitaker continues to oversee the inquiry, \u201che will create a constitutional crisis by inhibiting Mueller or firing Mueller.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d Mr. Schumer added, \u201cCongress has to act.\u201d As they prepare to take control of the House, Democrats are trying to strike a delicate balance between pressing ahead with their legislative agenda and investigating an administration that has operated for two years without any real oversight from Congress. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader who hopes to become speaker, insisted on Sunday that Democrats do not intend to play politics with their investigatory powers. \u201cWe are responsible. We are not scattershot,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe are not doing any investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth. So I think a word that you could describe about how Democrats will go forward in this regard is, we will be very strategic.\u201d But her colleagues made clear that they intend to move aggressively, not just in overseeing the Justice Department, but on a variety of fronts. Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who will become chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he intended to look at whether Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits federal officials from receiving gifts, or emoluments, from foreign powers. Many Democrats believe that Mr. Trump is violating the clause by continuing to profit from his worldwide real estate dealings. Mr. Cummings, speaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d said that \u201cthere are probably many\u201d violations by Mr. Trump. He also vowed to look into reports that Mr. Trump had blocked the federal government from moving the F.B.I. headquarters, which sits across Pennsylvania Avenue from his downtown Washington hotel, because doing so would have cleared the way for construction of a competing hotel. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out when is he acting on behalf of the American people in a lot of his decisions or \u2014 or is he acting on his own behalf?\u201d Mr. Cummings said. But he said he saw subpoenas as a last resort, and ducked a question about what he would do if the White House refused to comply with them. \u201cWe will cross that bridge when we get to it,\u201d he said. House Democrats also plan to investigate whether Mr. Trump used what Mr. Schiff called \u201cinstruments of state power\u201d to try to punish The Washington Post and CNN, whose journalists asked questions of the president that Mr. Trump did not like. The White House revoked the credentials of the CNN correspondent Jim Acosta last week after Mr. Acosta confronted Mr. Trump at a raucous news conference, and the president has warned that more journalists may lose their credentials. Mr. Schiff, in an interview with the website Axios, said Congress should examine whether Mr. Trump attempted to block AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner as \u201can effort to punish CNN.\u201d He also accused Mr. Trump of \u201csecretly meeting\u201d with the postmaster general to prod her into \u201craising postal rates on Amazon,\u201d whose chief executive and founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post. \u201cThis appears to be an effort by the president to use the instruments of state power to punish Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. But perhaps nothing is as high on Democrats\u2019 agenda as protecting the Mueller investigation. Mr. Whitaker has stirred deep concerns among Democrats since Mr. Trump, on the heels of the Republicans\u2019 loss of the House last week, named him acting attorney general after firing Jeff Sessions, who had long endured Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath over the Russia inquiry. Among other comments, Mr. Whitaker had once declared that there was \u201cno collusion\u201d between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 a remark that prompted Democrats to say he had prejudged the inquiry\u2019s conclusion. Mr. Whitaker\u2019s appointment went outside the usual Justice Department plan of succession. Ordinarily, Rod J. Rosenstein, who had protected the Russia inquiry as deputy attorney general, would have ascended to the top job. Unlike Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Whitaker, who was Mr. Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, lacks Senate confirmation. Democrats say the appointment is unconstitutional. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t recuse himself, if he has any involvement whatsoever in this Russia probe, we are going to find out,\u201d Mr. Schiff warned on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d adding, \u201cMr. Whitaker needs to understand that he will be called to answer, and any role that he plays will be exposed to the public.\u201d Mr. Schumer said he and Ms. Pelosi, along with other Democrats, were sending a letter to the top ethics officer at the Justice Department, asking whether he had advised Mr. Whitaker to withdraw. The department\u2019s ethics official had advised Mr. Sessions to withdraw from overseeing the investigation shortly after he took office last year, given his role in the Trump campaign, and Mr. Trump never forgave Mr. Sessions for stepping aside.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/us/politics/matthew-whitaker-russia-mueller-democrats.html", "date": "2018-11-11 00:00:00", "author": "By Sheryl Gay Stolberg", "description": "Newly empowered House Democrats threatened to subpoena the acting attorney general and take other measures as they push for his recusal from the investigation.", "title": "Top Democrats Vow to Block Matthew Whitaker From Interfering in Russia Inquiry"},
{"content": "Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Today\u2019s introduction comes from Thomas Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief.  The grim news from the devastated town of Paradise on Sunday came with an ominous asterisk. The Butte County sheriff announced that the death toll in and around the Sierra town had reached 29, matching the largest recorded number of deaths in modern California history from a single fire. The asterisk: More than 200 people remain unaccounted for, raising the possibility that more bodies will be recovered. Search crews and emergency workers have been scouring the incinerated remains of the town, which is still evacuated of its residents. Before the fire, Paradise had a population of around 27,000, many of them elderly. A startling 6,453 homes were destroyed. \u201cParadise is an old, wooded town with narrow surface streets \u2014 and it\u2019s a retirement community,\u201d said Scott McLean, the deputy chief of Cal Fire. The ferocity and speed of the flames were breathtaking, he said. \u201cThe winds were phenomenal, pushing everything down across the roadways. Roads were simply blocked. People ran out of gas. It was an accumulation of everything all at once.\u201d [Follow live updates on the fires from our reporters on the ground here.] Seven people died in their cars in Paradise. The blaze was so hot that aluminum wheels melted, as they did last year in Santa Rosa during the Tubbs Fire. In an article published Sunday, we examined how the trauma of the fire was compounded by the difficulty of escape. There was only one main road leading out of Paradise when the fire started on Thursday morning, and it quickly became swamped with traffic. As wildfires in California become larger and more intense, our story raises the question of how many other towns in the state have a similar vulnerability. Evacuation planning was not an oversight in Paradise. The mayor, Jody Jones, worked for years as a regional manager for the California Department of Transportation. Traffic management is her specialty. The town held evacuation drills. Ms. Jones worries that no amount of planning could have prevented the panicked gridlock in Paradise. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you could build the infrastructure to evacuate an entire town that quickly,\u201d she said. Wildfires are burning near the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Los Angeles shoreline. Track them here. Make sure to do your research before donating to charities.

These images are part of The Times\u2019s morgue, a 600,000-pound archive of pictures, newspaper clippings, encyclopedias and books \u2014 so heavy the collection needs a floor strong enough to handle the weight. Many of the pictures ran in The Times between the late 19th and 20th centuries. This vast collection is now part of a new archival storytelling project: Past Tense. And its first chapter is all about how The Times covered California in the 20th century. Why California? Veronica Chambers, the editor in charge, explained: The decision allowed us to cover a little bit of so many things that fascinated us: Hollywood and tech; the farm workers\u2019 movement and farm to table; a spectrum of political activity from the new conservatism to the Black Panthers. The paper\u2019s coverage of California as a land of possibility was decidedly not cynical. In 1963, we wrote: \u201cCalifornia is proudly flexing its sun-tanned muscles these days over the fact that, sometime in the last few months, it surpassed New York as the most populous state in the Union. The individual statistic who tipped the historic balance past the 17,300,000 mark may have been a newborn baby, or a young physicist from M.I.T. winging his way across Lake Tahoe. More likely, it was someone in a station wagon crowded with children and weary parents.\u201d Our package begins with an essay by the acclaimed novelist Walter Mosley, who writes about his life growing up in California, the son of a Jewish woman and an African-American man, who both came west after the end of World War II. Mosley writes, \u201cThe sun shone mercilessly, but no one asked for mercy. Everybody was rich because anything was possible.\u201d There were so many pictures that we loved of the Golden State that we couldn\u2019t fit them all into our package.

{"content": "In April 2017, progressives across America turned toward Georgia\u2019s Sixth District for the race to fill the House seat vacated by Tom Price, who\u2019d become President Trump\u2019s (short-lived) secretary of health and human services. That affluent, highly educated district in Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs had been solidly Republican for decades; Newt Gingrich had held it for 20 years, and Price won his 2016 election by more than 23 percentage points. But Trump had prevailed there only narrowly, and Democrats dreamed of using the special election to rebuke him. A great many local women, some awakened from political indifference by shock and revulsion at Trump\u2019s victory, threw themselves into his campaign. Money poured in from all over the country for the Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff. It became the most expensive House contest in history. He lost. Afterward, people complained \u2014 often on cable TV \u2014 that Democrats had squandered their money. But last week, some of that investment finally paid off. [Listen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast every Thursday morning with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] On Thursday we learned that a year and a half after Ossoff\u2019s loss, Lucy McBath, an African-American gun control advocate, had flipped the seat. McBath\u2019s victory was emblematic of the Resistance triumphs in the midterms. There was no immediate catharsis on Tuesday, no definitive national rebuke of a president whose bottomless depravity continues to dumbfound more than half the country. But the steady work of citizens who\u2019ve been trying, over the last two years, to fight the civic nightmare of Trumpism bore fruit. It was a slog, pockmarked with disappointments. At the end, though, there was hope. During the Ossoff campaign, \u201cwe built an army of volunteers,\u201d said Stacy Efrat, a mother of three with a full-time job who\u2019d organized voter registration drives most weekends this year. \u201cWe built the Resistance in the Sixth District, and we already had our infrastructure in place to work on the Lucy election.\u201d It took a while for the conventional wisdom of the American political class, accustomed to treating Democrats as hapless and disorganized, to catch up to what the Resistance had accomplished all over the country. There was an initial sense on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning that the midterms had been a letdown for Democrats, a blue trickle rather than a wave. Three of the marquee candidates progressives were most excited about \u2014 the gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia, and the Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas \u2014 seemed to fall short. (As of this writing, Gillum\u2019s race appears headed for a recount, and there\u2019s a possibility of a runoff election in Georgia.) Some of the first bellwether races to be called, including Amy McGrath\u2019s challenge to Representative Andy Barr, a Republican, in Kentucky, left progressives dispirited. By the end of the night, it was clear that Democrats won the House, but not by how much. In the following days, however, new races kept being called. McBath\u2019s victory was especially sweet. She\u2019d become an activist after the 2012 murder of her son, Jordan Davis, by a white man who, angry over loud music, shot up a car Davis was riding in. Running in her son\u2019s memory, she beat an incumbent with a top rating from the National Rifle Association in a largely white district. As I write this, Democrats have flipped at least 30 House seats, and their total haul could go as high as 40. Democrats virtually wiped out the Republican Party in the Northeast, but they also won new seats in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and South Carolina. The party is on track to make more gains in the House than it has in any election since Watergate's aftermath. Across the country, Democrats flipped at least 333 statehouse seats, a third of all those lost over the course of Obama\u2019s presidency. The seeds of this success were planted after Trump\u2019s election, when all over America scared, angry people searched for mechanisms that could constrain him. The democratic institutions that should have thwarted an authoritarian demagogue like Trump had failed, said Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, which would quickly become one of the most important Resistance groups. People were \u201clooking around to see who or what was going to come and save them,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd the answer was nothing. The answer was that they had to do it themselves.\u201d So newly mobilized activists got to work, and quickly realized that Trump was as much a symptom of American democratic rot as its cause. In many places Democrats had neglected local organizing, allowing the party to wither at the state and local level. Throughout Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Republicans had built up tremendous power in the state legislatures, which they\u2019d used to making voting harder. In the 2010 redistricting \u2014 the once-in-a-decade process of redrawing electoral maps \u2014 a significant degree of Republican gerrymandering gave the party an enduring advantage in the House of Representatives. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to remember now, but last year, many people thought it highly unlikely that Democrats could win the House, since Republicans had engineered a significant structural advantage. \u201cUltimately, Trump\u2019s approval rating probably needs to be at or below 35 percent for the House to flip,\u201d said The Cook Political Report. Levin recalled a meeting last year with allies and supporters in California. He told them that because grass-roots passions had grown so intense, \u201cI think we can take the House.\u201d But the notion felt so wishful, he recalled, \u201cYou had to say it in hushed tones. You couldn\u2019t say it out loud.\u201d Since then, Resistance energy has kept building on itself. Last year, Erin Zwiener, a children\u2019s book author, three-time \u201cJeopardy\u201d champion, and Indivisible activist in Texas, launched a campaign for state representative in her Republican-controlled district south of Austin. \u201cParticularly at the beginning, it definitely seemed uphill,\u201d she told me this week. But while her district had voted for Trump, the margin had been only about 4.5 percentage points, \u201cand we were seeing folks rise up against the presidency.\u201d Last October, she realized she was pregnant. Zwiener went into labor at a demonstration against migrant family separations, then campaigned with her newborn in tow. She used a photo of O\u2019Rourke kissing her baby in some of her ads. On Tuesday, she became one of 12 Texas Democrats to flip state House seats. (Democrats also flipped two State Senate seats.) Because there\u2019s another round of redistricting coming up in 2020, this has implications for the future makeup of Congress. \u201cWe can use our numbers to basically force more compromise votes,\u201d said Zwiener. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign, like Ossoff\u2019s before it, was not a waste. He became a vessel for masses of people who\u2019d felt alienated from their state\u2019s harsh right-wing politics, who longed for something more inclusive and humane but weren\u2019t sure it was possible. \u201cWhat I think was so important about Beto running is that it gave everybody hope,\u201d said Zwiener. \u201cBeto running made it so much easier to recruit statehouse candidates. Beto running made people feel like it was worth their time to come out and volunteer for candidates.\u201d The movement he leaves behind is likely to endure. Senator Ted Cruz beat O\u2019Rourke by less than three percentage points, which makes an eventual Democratic majority seem newly imaginable. \u201cWe will definitely win something statewide within the next two cycles,\u201d Zwiener said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to predict which thing. But we will win something.\u201d Shortly after the Sixth District was called for McBath, I asked Efrat if she was going to take a break. \u201cNow we\u2019re scrambling trying to get the provisional vote counted for Abrams,\u201d she said, referring to the fight over the tally in the Georgia governor\u2019s race. Consumed with that work, she felt bad about missing the protests on Thursday against the firing of Jeff Sessions that had sprung up all over the country at a moment\u2019s notice.  After this past week, people in the Resistance are exhausted.

{"content": "Father Ruskin Piedra, 84, can often be found at the New York City Immigration Court in downtown Manhattan, where the Cuban-American priest defends people facing deportation or seeking asylum in the United States. In 2003, he founded the Juan Neumann Center, a nonprofit that provides affordable immigration legal services to the community of Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Its headquarters are on the second floor of a building owned by Our Lady of Perpetual Help, a Roman Catholic church where Father Piedra also delivers Mass every afternoon. Sunset Park has gone through a demographic transformation over the past 50 years, shifting from a majority Irish, Italian and Scandinavian neighborhood to one that is predominantly Hispanic and Chinese. In the process, Our Lady of Perpetual Help has made some adjustments. For its priests, this now means daily Masses in English, Spanish and Chinese, catering to the needs of its parishioners, many undocumented. Recently Father Piedra, who is an accredited representative with the Department of Justice, talked about the evolution of his work under the Trump presidency. The following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation. Q. How has the Trump administration changed your work at the center? A. Now 80 percent of our asylum cases are being denied. For instance, back when we started, we had over 20 Gypsies from Romania asking for asylum. We won all those cases, because they were \u2014 and are still \u2014 persecuted in their home country, on account of their ethnicity. Lately, the same cases have been denied. We have to appeal each time. Also, we had started taking domestic violence asylum cases and we were winning. But recently, the Department of Justice told immigration judges: \u201cDon\u2019t accept those cases anymore.\u201d I have a hearing for a case in a couple of weeks. This man had a sister who\u2019d had a romantic relationship with a gang member in El Salvador. She decided she no longer wanted a part of it because the gang was really violent; she dropped him. The ex-boyfriend went to her house with some companions and shot her dead. The mother came in running: \u201cWhat\u2019s up? What\u2019s up?\u201d He shot her dead. When the brother arrived to the house, he saw them both dead and went to the police. The police said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going there, they\u2019re better armed than us.\u201d The gang said the brother was next. He came to the United States and is asking for asylum. It\u2019s going to be very difficult, because that\u2019s a case of gang violence, and they are not accepting those anymore. How did the separation of families at the Mexican border affect your work? Several unaccompanied minors came to us. But these cases of abandonment have to be handled in family court, and our center is only accredited to go to federal court. So we told them exactly where to go and what to ask for. Family separation used to happen before this summer, but not to the level of this administration. In 2012, for example, this woman, her husband and their child came to the United States through Mexico. They were all separated at the border. She couldn\u2019t speak a word of English and was given a court order in Texas, but never went. Within weeks, the family reunited and ended up in New York. I went to court here and asked the judge: \u201cCould you unite them under the same judge?\u201d He said: \u201cNo, she\u2019s got a deportation order for missing her court hearing.\u201d I went to the Board of Immigration Appeals, wrote up the whole thing. In 2017, they said that they agreed with me. I had to go back to the same judge. He said: \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy now!\u201d He wasn\u2019t happy. To have someone like me, a nobody, overturn a judge. The case is still pending. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about the caravan of migrants headed from Honduras to the Texas border. Could some of them become your clients? Definitely, though if they reach the border and see 15,000 U.S. troops, they may decide they have no business here. When we heard about the caravan in the news, we had a meeting here to discuss what resources we had. We want to be ready for them and we\u2019re not going to deny one single person to tell their story. If it has grounds for applying for asylum and we can handle it, we shall do it. I don\u2019t know how they get hold of our center, because we don\u2019t publicize anything, but they do. Clients have told us that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agents in Federal Plaza had advised them to come here. Carlos Menchaca, the councilman who represents Sunset Park, also directs them to us. How many deportation cases do you currently have? I have 14 hearings scheduled through the end of 2019 and God knows how many more cases that still have to be assigned a court date. It never stops, really. We had two attorneys who\u2019d just passed the bar and were helping me on those cases. But once they get a hold on things, they always move out and open their own place. So at this time, I\u2019m left alone to go to court and do not have the ability to keep up with all the cases. We have asylum seekers coming to the center just about every day. Before this administration, we may have averaged one or two a week. Courts are so backed up with asylum cases we now have hearings scheduled in 2021. What\u2019s your background? My parents were both Cuban. They came here in 1918. Were they running away from something? Nothing. In those days, you just went to Ellis Island and they stamped you: \u201cWelcome to the United States!\u201d I was born in East Harlem and decided to become a priest very young, in high school. I was an altar boy at Saint Cecilia Parish. One incident during a trip to Cuba really convinced me to become a priest. I was just visiting the church my parents used to go to, and I see this big priest, in the middle of the hot summer, all bundled up in wool, with collar and everything, praying the rosary. I thought, Wow, that level of sacrifice! I felt a calling then. How do you have time to just be a priest? Is there time for Mass? Everyday, in Spanish. I wear this hat from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. And, from 3 to 10 p.m., I wear another hat. Who are your parishioners? When I first came here, there were no Hispanic people working in the rectory\u2019s front office. The day before yesterday, I happened to go to the front office. No one spoke English. So most of your parishioners are Hispanic? Yes, the huge majority of them are, and we also have more and more Chinese converts. The few Irish who have stayed in the neighborhood are very helpful to the church. Is it true that your church conducts funeral services \u201cin absentia\u201d for undocumented parishioners who can\u2019t return to their countries of origin for funerals of loved ones?  Yes. Usually, con cuerpo presente (\u201cwith the body present\u201d) is when we have the funeral Mass. But here, when that\u2019s not possible, we put a bare catafalque with no casket and do a Mass with the family. The deceased person\u2019s spirit is certainly there. And that seems to be a great consolation for them. When I was with my first parish in Tampa, Fla., in the 1960s, we had those ceremonies as well with just a black catafalque for Cuban refugees who\u2019d escaped the Castro regime.  What are your parishioners\u2019 greatest concerns? Many are undocumented. They are afraid for their children. Because if Mom and Dad have to go back to El Salvador, with the certainty of facing persecution, if not death, what happens to their three American kids? How can you help them? We beg the judge. If they have kids born here, that\u2019s in their favor. The decision is not just based on the fact that you\u2019re here unlawfully, but also that you have three kids depending on you.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/nyregion/the-very-busy-life-of-an-immigrants-rights-priest-in-2018.html", "date": "2018-11-08 00:00:00", "author": "By Fabrice Robinet", "description": " Father Ruskin Piedra runs a legal aid center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, where he fights against deportation of his clients.

{"content": "America\u2019s best gymnasts have shaken their heads for years at the failure of their national federation to understand the blighted culture of their sport, one that allowed a team doctor to abuse them for decades while the sport\u2019s leaders looked the other way. A turning point appeared to come last winter in a Michigan courtroom. There, for nearly a week, more than 100 girls and women riveted a national audience with stories of sexual abuse and institutional neglect as Lawrence G. Nassar, the longtime national team doctor, sat listening a few feet away before a judge sentenced him to essentially a life term in prison. Yet just seven months later, the leadership of their sport let them down all over again, the gymnasts say, by not seeking their opinions on crucial moves, decisions that were among the reasons the United States Olympic Committee moved Monday to strip the federation of its governing powers. First, U.S.A. Gymnastics, the troubled national governing body, gave a powerful position to a coach who had a history of defending Nassar and a reputation, among many former gymnasts, for pushing athletes to unnecessary extremes and haranguing them about their weight. The appointment of that coach, Mary Lee Tracy, who had four decades of experience, fell apart quickly. The complaints it generated forced the organization\u2019s chief executive to resign. Just weeks later, the federation\u2019s board appointed Mary Bono, a former congresswoman, to serve as U.S.A. Gymnastics\u2019 interim chief executive. She lasted five days. Bono resigned under pressure after several prominent athletes complained about her lobbying work for a law firm that had advised U.S.A. Gymnastics in 2015 when the organization delayed publicly revealing reports about Nassar\u2019s assaults. As the federation enters a phase that may lead to its demise, longtime gymnasts remain befuddled over the mismanaged hiring. For them, the choices, most emblematically the Tracy decision, illustrated a continuing dysfunction in an organization they see as incapable of understanding the drastic changes needed to create a healthy environment for gymnasts at every level. A cursory search of the internet would have revealed Tracy defending Nassar and calling him \u201camazing\u201d in a 2016 television interview \u2014 after the first wave of accusations against him, from more than 50 athletes, was made public. Diligent outreach to gymnasts who trained under Tracy, or those who knew her athletes, would most likely have uncovered allegations of a physically and emotionally abusive atmosphere at her gym. A spokesman for U.S.A. Gymnastics declined to comment on the hiring process for Tracy. In an interview last month, Tracy said she had evolved as a coach over the last 10 years. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of some of the times in my early days of coaching,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the first one to say that I yelled too much at kids and I weighed kids, and I certainly don\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d Tracy has also called Nassar a monster, repudiating her comments in the television interview. Dominique Moceanu, a gold medalist on the 1996 Olympic team who trained at Tracy\u2019s Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy in the early 2000s, said she began texting with other gymnasts as soon as she learned that Tracy had been named the federation\u2019s elite development coordinator. \u201cAfter so many poor decisions, everybody was like, \u2018Seriously, you chose her?\u2019\u201d said Moceanu, who recently opened a gym in Ohio. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the eating disorders that have come out of her gym, or the problem with injuries that have come out of her gym? Have you not done any of your homework?\u2019\u201d Morgan White, a Tracy prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who made the Olympic team in 2000, never publicly discussed what she had endured as a gymnast until Tracy was chosen for the coordinator\u2019s job in August. White remembers feeling nauseated when she heard the news \u2014 and decided to speak up. At the time, White, 34, was recovering from a total hip replacement. She has had three hip operations, which she believes were necessitated by years of overtraining under Tracy\u2019s guidance.  The coach repeatedly called her fat, encouraging eating disorders that have persisted, White said, and also persuaded her to hide injuries when she was under consideration for national teams. At a training camp before the Sydney Olympics, White said, Tracy coerced her to forgo a protective boot and icing sessions on an injured foot so that the national team coordinators would not automatically deny her a spot on the Olympic team. White ultimately pulled out of the Games because of the injury. Nassar offered her friendship during those tough times, she said. Several gymnasts have said the doctor\u2019s positive attitude was partly why they did not challenge him as he molested them under the guise of medical treatment. Once when White was in a car with Nassar during a training camp, \u201che comforted me and rubbed my leg and said everything was going to be O.K., and that it wasn\u2019t fair that Mary Lee was treating me this way,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was the good guy in a sport of cruel people. He had already assaulted me by then.\u201d White, a plaintiff in one of the many lawsuits against U.S.A.G., said Nassar started abusing her when she was 16. Tracy, however, has described White as one of her \u201call-time favorite\u201d athletes. \u201cI feel like I was a good friend and a good coach to Morgan White,\u201d she said, adding that she had frequently encouraged White to put on weight. She said White had insisted on hiding the foot injury, which included not wearing a protective boot or icing the injury, and she said it was not uncommon for a star athlete to push through an injury, with the blessing of the parents, who don\u2019t want to derail their child\u2019s Olympic goals. \u201cIf I was such an awful person, then why did you keep driving your daughter to practice, sometimes twice a day, six days a week, and then pay me $300, $500 a month for it?\u201d Tracy said. Tracy also said that she had immediately reported a possible case of sexual misconduct to U.S.A. Gymnastics in 2015 after a mother called her to say that Marvin Sharp, the federation\u2019s 2010 coach of the year, had taken a lewd photograph of her daughter. Sharp was arrested on charges of child molestation and sexual misconduct, and he hanged himself in jail. Tracy has many supporters on all levels of the sport, including Jennie Leonard, who competed as Jennie Thompson on seven national teams, three of them under Tracy\u2019s command. She said Tracy \u201ckind of became my mom and was a very caring person.\u201d Tracy was obsessed with educating herself on safer training methods, Leonard said, and would have been \u201can amazing choice\u201d for the elite coordinator\u2019s job. \u201cI think some people are getting an unfair shake right now,\u201d Leonard said. Tracy said she applied for the U.S.A. Gymnastics development job in August through a posting on the federation\u2019s website and about a week later was interviewed by three federation officials at the national championships in Boston. Tracy said they asked her questions like, \u201cWhat would you do if you saw a coach verbally abusing an athlete at a camp or training event?\u201d and made other queries that focused on athlete safety. She said she was asked if she had had any contact with Nassar survivors, and she said yes. Tracy\u2019s appointment was announced on Aug. 28. Within a day, a backlash began among several Nassar victims, with the three-time Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman leading the way. \u201cUSA Gymnastics has appointed someone who, in my view, supported Nassar, victim-shamed survivors & has shown no willingness to learn from the past,\u201d Raisman wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is a slap in the face for survivors and further confirmation that nothing at USAG has changed.\u201d Tracy said Kerry Perry, the chief executive of the gymnastics federation, contacted her three days after the appointment and asked for her resignation, citing Tracy\u2019s contact with plaintiffs in one of the many lawsuits that the organization faces because of Nassar\u2019s crimes. \u201cNobody told me I couldn\u2019t talk to survivors,\u201d Tracy said. Perry, who did not respond to messages seeking comment, was forced out less than a week later, after nine months as the organization\u2019s president and chief executive. Perry\u2019s departure left a power vacuum: The federation\u2019s office in Indianapolis had no leader, and the task of finding a replacement fell to an inexperienced board of directors that had not been assembled until June. The previous board was forced to resign in the wake of the wrenching testimony at Nassar\u2019s sentencing hearings. In October, Sarah Hirshland, chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee, sent along the names of Bono and another potential candidate to the gymnastics federation\u2019s acting leadership, suggesting that the board interview them for the open chief executive\u2019s job. Bono, who had competed in gymnastics, quickly stepped into the interim job. The U.S.O.C. had vetted her credentials, and checked her social media activity. Just as quickly came another uprising from gymnasts, over Bono\u2019s lobbying work and a tweet of hers that opposed Nike\u2019s ad campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, the former N.F.L. quarterback who knelt during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. The U.S.O.C. had noted this tweet in its report. \u201cWhat people keep missing is that this is not a Larry Nassar story,\u201d said Rachael Denhollander, a lawyer and a former gymnast who was the first person to publicly accuse Nassar of assault. \u201cLarry was just a symptom of the real problem at U.S.A.G. because it fostered an abusive culture for decades.\u201d Last month, the gymnastics federation began searching for its next chief executive and sent an online survey to more than 200 people who are considered vital stakeholders in the sport. The questions included: \u201cWhat three characteristics of the next C.E.O. do you see as being most important?\u201d (Possible multiple-choice responses: A good listener? Knowledgeable about gymnastics?) \u201cWhat would you like to see changed about U.S.A.G.?\u201d \u201cPlease describe U.S.A.G.\u2019s current culture in three words.\u201d The survey wasn\u2019t out long before the U.S.O.C. moved to sever its ties with the gymnastics federation, which may have to declare bankruptcy in response to the lawsuits against it. Now U.S.A. Gymnastics, in its current incarnation, may not get a chance to hire anyone else.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/sports/-usa-gymnastics-scandal-.html", "date": "2018-11-10 00:00:00", "author": "By Juliet Macur", "description": "Less than a year after Larry Nassar\u2019s sentencing, decisions by U.S.A.

{"content": "Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican fixture in California who represented Orange County for 15 terms, has lost his bid for re-election. His defeat underlines the party\u2019s setbacks in a part of the state that was long a symbol of its political dominance. The Associated Press called the race on Saturday, with Harley Rouda receiving 52 percent of the vote to Mr. Rohrabacher\u2019s 48 percent. Mr. Rouda, 56, is a former Republican turned Democrat who became a symbol of the Democratic efforts to win back Congress this year. Mr. Rohrabacher, 71, was viewed as particularly vulnerable because he defended Russia in the midst of allegations about its efforts to intervene in elections in the United States. In July, Mr. Rohrabacher admitted to meeting with Maria Butina, who was charged by federal prosecutors this summer with conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent, during his trip to Russia in 2015. Mr. Rohrabacher was considered so valuable to the Kremlin that the F.B.I. warned him in 2012 that Russia regarded him as an intelligence source worthy of a code name. His support for President Vladimir Putin of Russia raised questions even among fellow Republicans. Mr. Rouda capitalized on that in his campaign, running ads emphasizing Mr. Rohrabacher\u2019s Putin ties and criticizing Mr. Rohrabacher for questioning the assertion by United States intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Mr. Rouda has said he is in favor of Medicare for All and a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage tied to inflation, along with free tuition at public colleges. In a post on Twitter after the race was called, he thanked his supporters \u201cwho dedicated countless hours to flipping\u201d the 48th Congressional District. He told The Associated Press that he intended to be \u201chonest, transparent, accessible and tireless\u201d in Washington. Democrats have focused on seven seats in California that were controlled by Republicans. The loss by Mr. Rohrabacher marks the third Democratic victory in those races. On Saturday night, three other races remained too close to call. Josh Harder, a Democrat, was ahead of Representative Jeff Denham by 1.9 percentage points in the 10th District. Representative Mimi Walters, a Republican, was leading Katie Porter by 0.9 percentage point in the 45th District. And Young Kim, a Republican, was beating Gil Cisneros by 1.4 percentage points in a race to replace Representative Ed Royce, a Republican who is retiring from the 39th District seat. Support for Republicans has been steadily eroding in Orange County; in 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win there since the Great Depression. Roughly a third of voters in the county are registered Republicans, down from more than half in 1990. About 30 percent of voters in the district are not registered with either party.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/politics/dana-rohrabacher-loses-harley-rouda.html", "date": "2018-11-10 00:00:00", "author": "By Adam Nagourney", "description": "Mr. Rohrabacher, who had represented Orange County for 15 terms, was viewed as vulnerable because of his support for President Vladimir Putin of Russia.", "title": "Dana Rohrabacher Loses, Eroding Republican Foothold in California"},
{"content": "The dark and sulfurous chamber of Thom Pain\u2019s mind has been unsealed for public inspection again. Audiences already familiar with Will Eno\u2019s \u201cThom Pain (based on nothing),\u201d which has been revived by the Signature Theater, may find this Stygian space roomier and less oppressive than they remembered. Oliver Butler\u2019s new production, which opened on Sunday night, lets some fresh air and even a sliver of sunlight into the nocturnal depths of its title (and only) character\u2019s imagination. And with a handsome, self-assured Michael C. Hall in the role of Pain (a last name that shrieks volumes), he appears as less of a lost cause than he once did. But while I\u2019m usually grateful for glints of optimism in these cynical times, I can\u2019t honestly say that this transformation is for the good. When I first saw \u201cThom Pain\u201d at the tiny Soho Theater in London in 2004, its masochistic bleakness lingered on my skin afterward like a toxic slime. I may have wanted to take a shower immediately, but I was also electrified by the original, full-frontal attack on the audience that Mr. Eno had engineered. It helped that Thom\u2019s despairing monologue was delivered by an angular, snarly James Urbaniak, whose utterances felt as dangerous as a double-edged razor blade in the hands of child. When Mr. Urbaniak\u2019s Thom crossed the Atlantic the following year for a long Off Broadway run, Mr. Eno (who was born in 1965) was hailed as the theater\u2019s new young messiah of existential despair. In a wonder-struck review in The New York Times, Charles Isherwood called him \u201ca Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation.\u201d If, in its latest incarnation, \u201cThom Pain\u201d seems to have shed its ability to shock, that\u2019s partly because we have had a chance to become accustomed to the skewed perspective of Mr. Eno, whose later, fuller works include \u201cThe Realistic Joneses\u201d and \u201cThe Open House.\u201d But this relative tameness is also a matter of Mr. Butler and Mr. Hall\u2019s interpretation. To begin with, Thom \u2014 who spends the play\u2019s 70 uninterrupted minutes wallowing in bitter self-consciousness \u2014 has been given more room to roam. Amy Rubin\u2019s set has transformed the Diamond Stage at the Pershing Square Signature Center into what feels like a limitless construction site, with ladders, tarps and a gaping hole cordoned off with yellow tape. The show still begins in total darkness, interrupted by the startling flame of someone trying \u2014 \u201ctrying\u201d being the operative word \u2014 to light a cigarette. \u201cHow wonderful to see you all,\u201d says a voice. That\u2019s our Thom, a man who lives to tease with prickly paradoxes and to undermine expectations \u2014 his and ours. \u201cDo you like magic?\u201d he asks, once the lights have come up to reveal Mr. Hall in a trim black suit, looking like a department-store mannequin. \u201cI don\u2019t. But enough about me.\u201d It is not enough, of course. The show proceeds as a sustained, cryptic, circular apologia pro vita sua, in which childhood tragedies and grown-up losses in love are anatomized like corpses in a forensic lab. That confession is sometimes told in the third person, sometimes in the first. But there\u2019s no question that it\u2019s always all about Thom \u2014 unless you believe, as he likes to insist teasingly, it\u2019s all about us, too, and our bewildered, desperate and ever-shrinking time on this planet. Mr. Hall has established himself an accomplished and adventurous actor, both on screen (\u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d \u201cDexter\u201d) and stage (brilliant as David Bowie\u2019s alien alter-ego in \u201cLazarus,\u201d and on Broadway in \u201cThe Realistic Joneses.\u201d). Yet his Thom is self-conscious in the wrong ways. His narrative of self-catechism and self-laceration has the carefully modulated quality of a classically trained actor doing an intense audition piece. Mr. Hall is best in relaxed moments of semi-improvised interaction with the audience. But this Thom is seldom lovably loathsome enough to make us squirm. Thus delivered, the script now registers as the product of a restless and very talented young dramatist, showing off and playing with the influences he has absorbed. The ghost of Beckett still hovers, but so do, just as visibly, the specters of T. S. Eliot, Edward Albee and Dostoyevsky\u2019s Underground Man. It\u2019s Mr. Eno\u2019s love for and grasp of rhythmic language that most impress here. Listen, for instance, to Thom\u2019s trying to remember what might have inspired a young boy\u2019s wet dream: \u201cSome fuzzy uneducated image of a girl, saying a word he liked. \u2018Voucher.\u2019 Or, \u2018Ankles.\u2019\u201d Thom\u2019s angst may feel a trifle sophomoric now, like something he might grow out of. But his way with words, and that of the man who created him, is already deliciously ripe.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/theater/thom-pain-review-michael-c-hall.html", "date": "2018-12-09 00:00:00", "author": "By Ben Brantley", "description": "In Oliver Butler\u2019s revival, Will Eno\u2019s reputation-making monologue of masochistic bleakness suddenly feels a lot less shocking.", "title": "Review: Michael C.

{"content": "Taylor Deen, 31, is a senior airship pilot for Goodyear in Carson, Calif. How did you end up piloting a blimp? After high school, I attended a pilot training school in San Diego, where I got my private pilot license in 2005 and my commercial license in 2007. Then I took a month of training at American Flyers in Santa Monica, Calif., to become a flight instructor. By the spring of 2008, they offered me a job to teach, and I took it. A year later, I was teaching a class on the ground when someone came in and told us there was a blimp on a low approach. Everyone ran to the window to watch it. We were only about 200 feet from the landing area. It seemed to fill the sky, and I was in awe. Almost a year later, I was looking for work and typed \u201cpilot jobs\u201d into Google. This Goodyear job popped up. I joined them in 2011. How many pilots are licensed to fly blimps in the world? About 40 to 50 pilots are flying fewer than 10 active blimps in the world today. Only a few I know of are women. What does it feel like to fly in a blimp and to pilot one? Most people compare the feeling to being in a big cruise ship. It shifts slightly with the winds, just like the effect ocean waves have on cruise liners and other ships. Part of the excitement is that the gondola \u2014 where passengers sit \u2014 has large windows, and, hovering at such low altitudes, the views are breathtaking. As pilots, we have to be aware of more than just the aerodynamics. We use gas laws and calculate lift capacity based on constantly changing variables such as temperature, pressure, passenger weights and fuel load. Goodyear\u2019s airships are equipped with the basic tools all pilots use: fly-by-wire flight controls, electronic flight display, Garmin GPS, weather radar, etc. We use engines that swivel. This allows us great maneuverability in the air and the capability to launch and land the airship vertically as well as to maintain higher cruise speeds. Can anyone book a flight as a passenger? No, we don\u2019t take reservations. We do offer rides to our Goodyear dealers around the country, and we also donate blimp rides to nonprofit organizations for charity auctions. The majority of our time in the air involves providing aerial television coverage of sports and entertainment events, including N.C.A.A. football, the N.F.L.\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d the U.S. Open golf tournament, N.B.A. basketball and Major League Baseball. We also spend considerable time traveling across the country to get to the events we cover. The top speed of our blimps is just 70 knots \u2014 that\u2019s 80 miles per hour. So going from my base in Carson to, say, Cleveland for the N.B.A. playoffs in 2017 took seven or eight days with overnight stops. Do the television networks pay Goodyear to shoot the sports events? We provide aerial coverage in exchange for Goodyear brand mentions within the programming. We have been providing aerial coverage since 1955.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/business/game-fly-a-blimp.html", "date": "2018-11-09 00:00:00", "author": "As told to Perry Garfinkel", "description": "Taylor Deen commands an airship that shifts slightly with the winds and provides aerial TV coverage of major sporting events in the United States.", "title": "Always a Great Seat at the Game, if You Can Fly a Blimp"},

In all his work, his interest lay not in the cataclysmic event but in its effects \u2014 on the landscape, the society and, especially, the individual people. \u201cI am not a war photographer,\u201d he said in a video made for a touring exhibition of his work, \u201cWar From the Victims\u2019 Perspective,\u201d in 2014, \u201cbecause being a war photographer means being there, taking risks.\u201d Instead he sought to capture the humanity he found in the aftermath, whether in panoramic shots or close-ups. One picture in that exhibition showed a displaced-persons dormitory in Cyprus \u2014 no people, but evidence of human habitation everywhere. Another consisted of a single aging face, one that reflected the effects of hardship but also retained dignity. Mr. Mohr explained why he thought the people in such situations welcomed him and his camera. \u201cThey invited me not because my approach was more gentle, but because people could identify with it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t identify with a corpse, but you can identify with someone at a well drawing water to take to a camp a few kilometers away.\u201d Mr. Dahinden said Mr. Mohr\u2019s work was different from much photography from troubled areas. \u201cToo often victims are portrayed without respecting them as persons,\u201d he said. \u201cToo often they become tokens in a narrative for a purpose that serves others and become victims for a second time. That is never the case with Jean Mohr\u2019s works.\u201d Hans Adolf Mohr was born on Sept. 13, 1925, in Geneva. His parents had emigrated from Germany in 1919 and were dismayed by the rise of Hitler; from an early age their son rejected his Germanic origins and used the name Jean. He received a degree in economics and social sciences at the University of Geneva and briefly worked in advertising. Then he moved to the Middle East and spent two years working with Palestinian refugees on behalf of the United Nations Relief and Work Agency and the International Committee of the Red Cross. He studied art in Paris before, at age 30, discovering photography. Thereafter he worked taking photographs for international organizations all over the world. Not all his pictures were of war zones and refugee camps; he documented a rehabilitation hospital in Laos, dissident artists in Moscow, a tour of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. Whatever the subject, the label \u201chumanist\u201d was invariably attached to him and his pictures; he had the ability to infuse an image with heart and respect. \u201cWhen he works with people, he becomes almost invisible,\u201d Mr. Berger, the critic, essayist and novelist who died last year, once noted. \u201cThat is to say, after a few minutes, he is there, he is taking pictures and people (even people who are being photographed) do not know. And I believe that this gift \u2014 because it is a gift to John \u2014 comes because of an extraordinary discretion, a discretion that is related to how he can relate to others. So it gives people the opportunity to keep their own presence and their own soul.\u201d Mr. Mohr collaborated with Mr. Berger on three books: \u201cA Fortunate Man: The Story of a Country Doctor\u201d (1967); \u201cA Seventh Man,\u201d about migrant workers (1975); and \u201cAnother Way of Telling\u201d (1982). All were praised for the intricacy of the collaboration. \u201cJean Mohr\u2019s defining characteristic \u2014 the one repeated by others, the one certainly in evidence every time I met him, and perhaps the one which made the eloquence of his photographs possible \u2014 was his humility,\u201d Tom Overton, who has edited two books about Mr. Berger, said by email. \u201cJohn Berger admitted himself somewhat less humble when he claimed the three books they worked on together \u2018considerably extended the narrative dialogues that are possible between text and images in book form.\u2019 Looking back now, they still haven\u2019t really been surpassed.\u201d In 1986 Mr. Mohr was involved in a similar collaboration with Dr. Said, the literary scholar, called \u201cAfter the Last Sky: Palestinian Lives.\u201d \u201cHe saw us as we would have seen ourselves, at once inside and outside our world,\u201d Dr. Said, an advocate of Palestinian independence who died in 2003, wrote in that book of Mr. Mohr\u2019s photographs. Richard Ben Cramer, reviewing the book for The New York Times, wrote: \u201cThis is not a normal tandem of word and image, neither a coffee-table book with a long, glorified caption nor a work of prose propped up here and there by sheaves of shiny pictures. Mr. Said writes to the photos so assiduously and with such effect as to make one powerful essay. And at times, we realize with a sobering lurch, he writes not to the pictures but from them.\u201d In 1956 Mr. Mohr married Simone Turrettini. She survives him. His other survivors include two sons, Michel and Patrick, and several grandchildren. Mr. Mohr\u2019s \u201cWar From the Victims\u2019 Perspective,\u201d which focused on images from the Palestinian territories, Cyprus and Africa, was seen in more than 20 countries. Some of its 60 pictures were of children, smiling and playing amid desolation. \u201cThe children in these photos are miraculous,\u201d Mr. Mohr said in the video made for the exhibition. \u201cLittle is enough for them to switch into playing a game. I had no problem showing them in difficult situations, because where there is the laughter of children, there is always hope.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/obituaries/jean-mohr-dead.html", "date": "2018-11-08 00:00:00", "author": "By Neil Genzlinger", "description": "He toured the world, often to record the aftermath of calamity, and collaborated on books with acclaimed writers.", "title": "Jean Mohr, Photographer Who Found Heart Amid Bleakness, Dies at 93"},
{"content": "For Chris Lotspeich, Veterans Day is a family affair.  It\u2019s a chance to honor his grandfather who served as a naval officer during World War II, and his cousin who still serves as a colonel.  But, for the first time, that family celebration took place on Fifth Avenue, where Mr. Lotspeich, 52, and his family were among the thousands of spectators who gathered Sunday for New York\u2019s annual Veterans Day Parade.  \u201cIt\u2019s important for people to appreciate the sacrifices of our veterans,\u201d said Mr. Lotspeich, who was dressed in traditional Scottish garb to honor his family\u2019s heritage.  This year\u2019s parade \u2014 stretching from 26th Street to 46th Street \u2014 featured thousands of participants, including members of local military schools, historical societies and active duty military members.  Florent Groberg, who received the Medal of Honor for his services in Afghanistan, served as the Grand Marshal.  Mr. Lotspeich, who lives in Glastonbury, Conn., applauded the public recognition of veterans, and said he hoped events like the parade would spark improvements to the treatment of veterans.  \u201cOur society likes to honor our veterans, but it typically does not follow through with taking care of them in terms of benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps this will help build public support for stronger veterans programs and services.\u201d This year\u2019s parade also celebrated 100 years since the end of World War I, and many participants honored that history.  \u201cIt\u2019s just the icing on the cake,\u201d Myra Carvalho, a Marine Corps veteran, said about the World War I centennial.

{"content": "The Great War was ending so New York City went wild, from its harbors to churches and streets and skyscrapers. The electric charge of that moment can still be felt a century later in a letter from Captain John F. Sweeney of the 15th Precinct in Manhattan, who described the scene to one of his men serving overseas. A police officer at 14th Street and Third Avenue called the station house at 3:30 a.m. to say that he had spotted an extra edition \u2014 that era\u2019s version of a news alert \u2014 announcing the signing of the Armistice that ended World War I. \u201cAt 4:15 the first steam whistle was going, to be followed by another, first from one section of the city and then another, then the church bells to peal out the wonderful news, heads began to appear from the windows and people would say, hey cop, what is it all about,\u201d Captain Sweeney wrote, breathless in punctuation, \u201cand if I answered one, I answered 150 that the war was over.\u201d [See previously unpublished photos of Armistice Day celebrations from around the world.] Captain Sweeney\u2019s letter reached Officer Emmanuel Zwerling, 31, who was serving with the 308th Infantry in France. The letter has a hand-drawn cartoon of the hated Kaiser Wilhelm II, the German emperor, and also casually refers to New York Italians with an epithet common in those days. Officer Zwerling\u2019s great-granddaughter, Jennifer Krohn, gave the letter and other memorabilia to the city\u2019s Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association.  \u201cPeace seemed to breathe in the very atmosphere,\u201d the captain said, for all the boisterous carry-on.

{"content": "Peter Mulroy is loyal to the University of Notre Dame\u2019s football team, which won one for the Gipper in the 1920s and is undefeated this season as it practices for Saturday\u2019s game against Syracuse University at Yankee Stadium. The basement in Mr. Mulroy\u2019s house, on Staten Island, is a shrine to the team, with banners and photographs celebrating the Fighting Irish. He talks proudly about once high-fiving Rudy Ruettiger, the former Notre Dame walk-on famous for sacking a quarterback during the final seconds of the only game of his college career. Mr. Ruettiger\u2019s story was the basis of the 1993 movie \u201cRudy.\u201d It is no coincidence that Mr. Mulroy\u2019s Shih Tzu is named Rudy. It is no wonder that Mr. Mulroy\u2019s wife, Linda, says, \u201cI feel like my whole world revolves around Notre Dame.\u201d But Mr. Mulroy never graduated from Notre Dame. He did not even attend Notre Dame. Mr. Mulroy, a retired New York City police detective, is what Notre Dame calls a \u201csubway alum,\u201d someone who roots for Notre Dame but does not have a Notre Dame diploma. The term \u201csubway alums\u201d was coined a century ago, when Notre Dame played some away games in New York. Now Notre Dame uses the term for people who aren\u2019t graduates of the school but are involved in alumni affairs nationally, including those in places that do not have subways. The University of Notre Dame Club of Staten Island has 43 members who graduated from the school, \u201cbut our total membership is over 160 because of guys like me\u201d and parents of undergraduates, said Joseph Delaney, a former club president who graduated in 1967 from Seton Hall University, which has not had a varsity football team since 1981. Notre Dame\u2019s president, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, said fans who didn\u2019t graduate from the school but who go to Notre Dame tailgate parties and games, collect Notre Dame memorabilia and conduct community service projects are \u201cunique.\u201d Subway alums are so important to the school that Mr. Delaney was recently named the first non-alumnus on Notre Dame\u2019s alumni board of directors. \u201cI\u2019ve seen schools like Texas or Michigan that are larger and nationally known that have fan bases,\u201d Chase Carter, president of the Council of Alumni Marketing and Membership Professionals who is also an official at Oklahoma State University\u2019s alumni association, said. \u201cBut nothing like this.\u201d The rise of the subway alums coincided with Notre Dame\u2019s desire for its football team to be recognized nationally, which is why it scheduled games in New York. But there was more to Notre Dame during that era than football. The team\u2019s fame \u201ccoincided with the immigrant wave and an anti-immigrant attitude and a little bit of anti-Catholic attitude,\u201d Father Jenkins said. \u201cIt became the team of this immigrant population, this group that was new to this country.\u201d Also, he added, \u201cNotre Dame scored a few stunning upsets. That helped.\u201d Father Jenkins said his father hooked him on watching Notre Dame games when he was growing up in Nebraska. \u201cIt became your identity,\u201d he said. \u201cYour teams when you\u2019re 13 are the teams you root for, for life. It\u2019s associated with memory, family, coming together. It has this resonance that goes beyond the sport.\u201d For many around the country, Notre Dame represented something bigger than a school or a team. \u201cMy dad was an Irish-Catholic blue collar man who took great pride in what Notre Dame stood for,\u201d Mr. Delaney said. \u201cIt was a matter of pride to my dad that the football players graduated, became doctors, became lawyers and some of them became clergy, but Notre Dame football gave them entry into the American mainstream. Guys like my dad who didn\u2019t go to college identified with that.\u201d Mr. Mulroy \u2014 who graduated from The College of Staten Island \u2014 said he would often put the Notre Dame game on the radio during his police shift. \u201cIn between calls, in between any situations, you always had the Notre Dame game on,\u201d he said. Once, he and his partner, while off duty, went to a Giants-Jets game and heard the Notre Dame fight song among the tailgaters in the parking lot. The two ended up joining the tailgate and were introduced to Joe Nagy, the sheriff of St. Joseph County, Ind., home to Notre Dame. \u201cHe was introduced to us as the sheriff of Notre Dame,\u201d Mr. Mulroy said. \u201cI said, \u2018Sure, you\u2019re the sheriff of Notre Dame like I\u2019m the sheriff of Nottingham Forest.\u2019\u201d They became fast friends. New York has produced more than subway alums for Notre Dame, of course. \u201cThe first-ever Notre Dame Heisman Trophy candidate was from Staten Island,\u201d Mr. Delaney said. \u201cWilliam Shakespeare. I kid you not. Notre Dame\u2019s quarterback in 1935. He finished third in the Heisman Trophy. And you know what? He was a Protestant.\u201d Mr. Mulroy has attended home games in Indiana, making friends with tailgaters from South Bend and reciprocating, with help from a caterer, when Notre Dame played in the New York area and Fighting Irish fans came east. Mr. Mulroy\u2019s daughter Cara, who went to Catholic University in Washington and now lives in Austin, Tex., also cheers on Notre Dame. \u201cHer fianc\u00e9\u2019s not too crazy about it,\u201d Mr. Mulroy said. \u201cHe\u2019s a U.T. fan\u201d \u2014 the University of Texas \u2014 \u201cand she follows the Irish.

{"content": "MANILA \u2014 A Philippine court on Friday sentenced Imelda R. Marcos, the country\u2019s flamboyant former first lady, to a minimum of 42 years in prison for creating private foundations to hide her unexplained wealth. But it is unlikely that Ms. Marcos, a 89-year-old widow, will see any jail time. The court, which handles graft and public corruption cases, said the ruling could be appealed, and legal experts have said Ms. Marcos could fight a prison sentence because of her advanced age. The sentence comes as Mrs. Marcos and her family have seen a political resurgence in the Philippines, having gained favor under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. The court found her guilty of seven counts of graft, with each count punishable by a minimum of six years in prison. The ruling also automatically disqualifies Mrs. Marcos, who is a congresswoman, from holding any public office. Mrs. Marcos did not appear in court for the sentencing, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. In a statement later Friday, Mrs. Marcos said her lawyer was studying the ruling and intended to file a motion asking the court to reconsider it. The lengthy sentence drew praise from some leading opponents of Mr. Duterte, who has in the past praised the brutal dictatorship of Mrs. Marcos\u2019s deceased husband, Ferdinand Marcos. Loretta Ann Rosales, the country\u2019s former human rights commissioner, who was tortured as an activist in the 1970s for opposing Mr. Marcos, called the sentence a symbolic victory for the thousands who died resisting the dictatorship. \u201cI am literally jumping with joy,\u201d Ms. Rosales said in an interview. She said the ruling showed that there were still public corruption judges \u201cwho have helped keep the candles lit through these dark nights and pursued the truth.\u201d She said the ruling also proved that the Marcoses and their cronies were guilty of raiding government coffers in order to enjoy a lavish lifestyle while millions of Filipinos lived in poverty. Neither Mrs. Marcos nor her lawyers could immediately be reached for comment. The charges against Mrs. Marcos took more than a quarter-century to prosecute, largely because many people who could have been witnesses had died or were too old to testify. The charges were filed in 1991, when state prosecutors accused Mrs. Marcos of creating private foundations in Switzerland and having financial interests in several companies when she was governor of Manila between 1978 and 1984. Prosecutors said the fake firms hid money that her family stole from the government. The prosecutors wrapped up their presentation in 2015, but Mrs. Marcos\u2019s lawyers successfully delayed the hearings by not appearing in court. Among those who testified against Mrs. Marcos was Frank Chaves, the country\u2019s late solicitor general, who filed a sworn statement that said Mrs. Marcos had used the foundations in Switzerland to hide millions of dollars of stolen wealth. The government successfully recovered some $658 million that the Marcoses held in Swiss financial institutions. But officials believe that is just a fraction of the roughly $10 billion they say the Marcoses stole from the Philippines. Ferdinand Marcos\u2019s two-decade rule was ended by the 1986 \u201cpeople power\u201d revolution. The Marcoses were sent into exile in Hawaii, where Mr. Marcos died three years later. The family was subsequently allowed to return home, where they re-established a base in their hometown, Ilocos Norte, in the northern Philippines. The Marcoses\u2019 political fortunes surged after Mr. Duterte was elected president two years ago. Mr. Duterte, who often describes himself as a fan of the late dictator, has credited the Marcos family with consolidating support for him in the north. In 2016, he allowed Mr. Marcos\u2019s remains to be reburied in a heroes\u2019 cemetery in Manila, leading toprotests. Mr. Duterte has also backed Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\u2019s appeal of his narrow loss in the vice-presidential election that year. A spokesman for Mr. Duterte, Salvador Panelo, said Friday that the president respected the court\u2019s decision. \u201cWhile we note that there are still legal remedies available to Congresswoman Marcos, this latest development underscores that our country currently has a working and impartial justice system that favors no one,\u201d Mr. Panelo said. One of the Marcoses\u2019 daughters, Imee Marcos, is running next year for the Philippine Senate. She recently refused demands by rights groups that she apologize for her father\u2019s atrocities, calling on the public to \u201cmove on.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/world/asia/imelda-marcos-sentenced-philippines.html", "date": "2018-11-09 00:00:00", "author": "By Jason Gutierrez", "description": "The Philippines\u2019 flamboyant former first lady, who is 89 years old, can appeal the sentence and is unlikely to actually see jail time.", "title": "Imelda Marcos Is Sentenced to Decades in Prison for Corruption"},

A mystery buyer spent about $390,000 on the wheelchair, a motorized model that had belonged to the physicist and author Stephen W. Hawking, who died in March at age 76. That is more than 15 times the pre-sale estimate made public by Christie\u2019s. It was among 22 items on offer from Dr. Hawking\u2019s estate in an online auction that began on Oct. 31. All of those were sold, and the total, about $1.8 million, was about seven times as much as had been predicted. \u201cThe results of this remarkable sale, with more than 400 registered bidders from 30 different countries, demonstrate the enormous admiration and affection with which Stephen Hawking was viewed around the world,\u201d according to a statement from Thomas Venning, the head of books and manuscripts for Christie\u2019s, and James Hyslop, the head of science and natural history. Altogether, the items auctioned, which also included possessions of Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein, were sold for more than $2.3 million. The red wheelchair was used by Dr. Hawking during the late 1980s and early \u201990s; he stopped using it when he could no longer steer it with his hands. The physicist spent most of his life steadily losing control over his muscles because of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.

{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is ending air refueling flights for the Saudi military campaign in Yemen and preparing sanctions against Saudis linked to the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, current and former American officials said on Friday. The moves would impose a limited punishment on the kingdom. The steps appear calibrated to respond to international outrage over the death of Mr. Khashoggi and to thousands of civilian deaths in the Yemen war, but avoid directly punishing the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and could head off tougher congressional action. Mr. Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government who wrote for The Washington Post and lived in Virginia, was killed last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by what the Turkish government has described as a kill team dispatched from Riyadh, the Saudi capital. President Trump has called the killing of Mr. Khashoggi a \u201cvery sad thing, very terrible thing,\u201d but his administration has signaled it intends to continue working with Prince Mohammed. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser on the Middle East, is the prince\u2019s biggest supporter in the White House. On Friday night, hours after The New York Times and The Washington Post reported on the Trump administration\u2019s decision to end the air refueling flights, the Saudi-led coalition waging war on Houthi rebels in Yemen announced that it would do the refueling on its own. This came after \u201cconsultation with the United States,\u201d it said. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said afterward that the United States supported the decision. The Trump administration is also expected to soon announce economic sanctions against Saudi officials linked to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, according to current and former officials. They said senior officials at the White House and State and Treasury Departments had discussed imposing the sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act, which gives the executive branch the power to punish foreign officials involved in human rights abuses. The announcement could come in days. Last week, Mr. Mattis and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called on all sides in the war to end hostilities and take part in United Nations-led negotiations. But Saudi leaders did not immediately move to limit their airstrikes, angering some in the Trump administration, according to former officials. \u201cThe Saudis have escalated; they have intensified the war,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt is a very public rebuke of both the secretary of state and the secretary of defense by the Saudis. The administration has not said anything about that. But curtailing air refueling would be their response.\u201d The American support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen has been deeply controversial, especially as civilian casualties have mounted \u2014 many children are among the victims \u2014 and a famine resulting from the war has gripped the country. The administration has faced growing bipartisan criticism over the American military\u2019s support for the Saudi campaign. On Friday, Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, called for an end to the air refueling mission. \u201cIf the administration does not take immediate steps, including ending U.S. refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft, we are prepared to take additional action when the Senate comes back into session,\u201d the senators said in a statement. The American military is considering other measures to try to help blunt the excesses and missteps of the Saudi military conducting the war, including prodding Riyadh to tighten its rules of engagement and improve its targeting. But the problem for the Saudi military is that after missiles fired from Yemen strike near Saudi cities, the kingdom\u2019s leaders demand immediate reprisals. Senior American officials said they hoped they could persuade the Saudi military to exercise more discipline and care. Officials said the ending of the refueling was not directly related to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. But some current and former officials said the rising pressure by the United States for Saudi Arabia to de-escalate the war was unlikely to have been as strong except for the outrage over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death. Since the beginning of the Saudi war in Yemen, the United States military has been conducting air refueling missions to aid the offensive. Last month, Mr. Mattis said that only about 20 percent of Saudi sorties used American refueling aircraft. In September, Mr. Pompeo provided formal certification saying that Saudi Arabia and the coalition it was leading in the Yemen war were taking significant actions to limit harm to civilians. The certification is needed for the United States military to refuel aircraft from the Saudi-led coalition. A congressional act passed in August requires the United States to provide certification every 180 days. Mr. Pompeo faced significant resistance to the certification from several bureaus inside the department, including from the Near Eastern affairs bureau. In his late October speech, Mr. Mattis set a deadline for an end to the violence. \u201cThirty days from now, we want to see everybody around a peace table based on a cease-fire, based on a pullback from the border,\u201d he said. The sanctions expected to be announced soon follow minor punishments that Mr. Pompeo laid out last month. In late October, he said the United States was gathering information on what happened to Mr. Khashoggi and the role of Saudi officials in the murder. He announced at the time that the United States was putting 21 Saudis on a visa blacklist or canceling visas that they already held. Those 21 presumably included 15 Saudi citizens whom Turkey had named at the time as being involved, as well as Saudi officials who were dismissed from their posts that month. \u201cThese penalties will not be the last word on the matter from the United States,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said at the time. It is unclear to what degree the targets of the coming sanctions will overlap with the 21 on the visa blacklist. On Oct. 10, bipartisan leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wrote to Mr. Trump demanding an investigation into Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, including whether \u201cthe highest-ranking officials in the government of Saudi Arabia\u201d were involved. The 22 members of Congress who signed the letter said the Trump administration should use the Global Magnitsky Act to impose sanctions on those involved. The prospect of Saudi sanctions was raised at an internal Treasury Department meeting on Thursday when Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, was asked how the administration planned to respond to the killing. A Treasury employee in the room said that Mr. Mnuchin lamented the horrible nature of the killing and suggested that some action was likely to be taken in the next week. A Treasury spokeswoman confirmed the subject had been discussed at an internal meeting but disputed that account, saying that the secretary made no such promise.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/us/politics/trump-saudi-sanctions-refueling.html", "date": "2018-11-09 00:00:00", "author": "By Julian E.

{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, lashed out at Beijing just ahead of a meeting between President Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, predicting that Mr. Trump would have the \u201ccourage\u201d to reject a bad trade deal with China. Mr. Navarro, a blunt populist who has long held unsparing views about China\u2019s rise, suggested that reaching a trade deal would be more difficult than Mr. Trump\u2019s recent comments would indicate, despite the intervention of Wall Street executives who have urged the president to repair relations quickly. The United States and China have been locked in a tit-for-tat trade war that many economists believe will eventually be a drag on economic growth. The White House has placed tariffs on about $250 billion worth of Chinese imports and has threatened to tax nearly all Chinese goods if Beijing does not agree to end trade practices that harm American companies, including pressuring firms to hand over valuable technology. China has retaliated with its own tariffs and recently accused the United States of adopting a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d approach to trade. Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump are scheduled to meet in Buenos Aires this month during the Group of 20 conference, and the trade dispute is expected to be a central topic. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that China wants to make a deal, and on Wednesday he said he was also hoping to reach an agreement with Beijing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and make a deal with China because I want to have great relationships with President Xi, as I do, and also with China,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference. Inside the White House, Mr. Navarro\u2019s broadside was seen as an effort to fend off more moderate trade advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who are trying to soften the president\u2019s stance toward China during the G-20. Mr. Navarro\u2019s remarks contrasted sharply with Mr. Trump\u2019s more upbeat assessment last week, when he told reporters at the White House that he was \u201cgetting much closer to doing something\u201d with China. \u201cThey want to get us to the bargaining table, sound reasonable, talk their way and have their way with us,\u201d Mr. Navarro said of China\u2019s trade negotiators, speaking without notes before an audience at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan Washington think tank. \u201cThe biggest problem,\u201d he added, \u201cis the trust issues.\u201d Mr. Navarro has privately expressed exasperation at the access to Mr. Trump enjoyed by Wall Street executives \u2014 whom he terms \u201cglobalists\u201d \u2014 like Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group, one of the world\u2019s biggest private equity investment firms. Mr. Schwarzman, who speaks with the president frequently on economic matters, has advised Mr. Trump to show restraint with China. \u201cIf there is a deal \u2014 if and when there is a deal \u2014 it will be on President Donald J. Trump\u2019s terms. Not Wall Street terms,\u201d Mr. Navarro said in his speech on Friday. \u201cIf Wall Street is involved and continues to insinuate itself into these negotiations, there will be a stench around any deal that\u2019s consummated because it will have the imprimatur of Goldman Sachs and Wall Street.\u201d A senior White House official described the comment as a thinly veiled tweak at Gary D. Cohn, a Goldman Sachs executive who served as chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council until this year and who described the China tariffs as a \u201ctax on Americans\u201d in an interview this week. Mr. Navarro frequently sparred with Mr. Cohn over trade while the two worked together at the White House, and Mr. Cohn ultimately resigned after his views were essentially ignored by the president. Two White House advisers said that Mr. Navarro was not expressing the president\u2019s views but his own. He did not inform Mr. Mnuchin or Larry Kudlow, who succeeded Mr. Cohn as director of the economic council, that he planned to speak, they said. Mr. Navarro said during the speech that negotiating the trade deal with China was \u201cnot my lane\u201d and that the responsibility would fall to Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative. But the two are largely in lock step when it comes to China, and Mr. Lighthizer is pessimistic about the prospects of reaching a significant new deal with Chinese negotiators in Argentina, according to officials with direct knowledge of his views. At a summit meeting in Washington on Friday, Yang Jiechi, a top Chinese foreign policy official, said the United States and China needed to resolve the trade conflict soon rather than escalate it. \u201cA trade war, instead of leading to any solution, will only end up hurting both sides and a global economy,\u201d Mr. Yang said at a news conference. Mr. Yang and the Chinese defense minister, Wei Fenghe, were in town to meet with Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, as part of a regular dialogue that had been established by the presidents of the two nations. American business leaders, who have been watching the China talks nervously from the sidelines, have urged the White House to approach the Buenos Aires meeting with an open mind. \u201cIt\u2019s constructive to have both sides talking,\u201d said Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents 200 American companies that do business with China. \u201cIf Beijing has something substantive to offer, we should be willing to negotiate. We need to take this seriously,\u201d she added. Mr. Navarro dismissed previous promises made by Chinese leaders. He singled out unresolved issues around intellectual property protections for American companies, China\u2019s military occupation of disputed islands in the South China Sea and Mr. Xi\u2019s pledge to buy more American beef, made to Mr. Trump during the leader\u2019s dinner with the president at Mar-a-Lago last year. \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d he asked.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/us/politics/peter-navarro-china-trade.html", "date": "2018-11-09 00:00:00", "author": "By Glenn Thrush", "description": "Peter Navarro, a populist who has long held unsparing views about China\u2019s rise, suggested that reaching an agreement would be more difficult than President Trump\u2019s recent comments would indicate.", "title": "Trump Trade Adviser Warns That There Will Be No Quick Deal With China"},
{"content": "How to take on a one-ton gorilla? We sent both of our chief critics to \u201cKing Kong,\u201d the $35 million, Australian-born musical that opened Thursday night at the Broadway Theater. Far from Skull Island and the wrath of Kong, they huddled to talk it out. BEN BRANTLEY Hello, Jesse. Though I\u2019m not in a playful mood this morning \u2014 having just seen the spirit-crushing \u201cKing Kong\u201d \u2014 what if we begin this dialogue with a game? Imagine you are on the street, having just left the theater, and are asked by a television interviewer to describe your response in one word. Well? JESSE GREEN It can\u2019t be printed here, and I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s one word. (It starts with \u201cape.\u201d) So I guess I\u2019ll go with \u201cugh.\u201d BRANTLEY I understand what you\u2019re saying. Since screaming is such a big part of the show, mine would be \u201caaaaaaaaargh.\u201d GREEN We were hoping in reviewing this together that one of us might have something nicer to say than the other one does. But it looks like our opinions rhyme at least as well as most of the lyrics in the show. BRANTLEY You mean like, \u201cBut this is not the end of me / \u2019Cause this beast is clemency\u201d? GREEN When I see a musical drawn from a work in another genre \u2014 in this case the 1933 movie and its novelization \u2014 one thing I look for is the added value. What is gained in bringing \u201cKing Kong\u201d to the stage? Certainly not provocative or insightful songwriting. The score is a hodgepodge of soundtrack-style murk by Marius de Vries and a clutch of no-profile songs by Eddie Perfect, whose score for \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d is heading toward Broadway even as we speak. Did you think the music added anything? BRANTLEY No, but I think you\u2019re missing the point. The only reason for this \u201cKing Kong\u201d to exist is its title character. So before we eviscerate the show, directed and choreographed by Drew McOnie, shall we briefly praise the animatronic ape (designed by Sonny Tilders)? GREEN Sadly, I have mixed feelings about Kong himself. Certainly he is the most expressive performer onstage, what with the platoon of puppeteers and voice artists bringing him to life. Only they don\u2019t quite get there. Even aside from his long-waisted baby body, there is something logy and jowly about him; he seems like Khrushchev on Thorazine. BRANTLEY Yeah, I thought of a (barely) animated gargoyle from the Notre Dame cathedral. Disney casting agents, are you listening? [What\u2019s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] GREEN The adapters of this \u201cKing Kong\u201d seem to have two stories they wanted to tell. One is a morality tale about the evil of trapping a living being in a cheap entertainment scheme. To judge from my own misery in the audience, I\u2019d say this is a theme they mastered. BRANTLEY And the other theme, would that be the equation of ape in captivity with the oppression of women? GREEN Yes. A feminist angle is attempted, not very convincingly. When the plucky farm girl Ann Darrow (Christiani Pitts) arrives in Manhattan intent on making it big in showbiz, it\u2019s with an explicit streak of post-liberation consciousness. \u201cAt least I\u2019m not some man\u2019s property,\u201d she sings in a song called \u201cQueen of New York.\u201d BRANTLEY And when Kong \u2014 dragged from his native Skull Island to Depression-era New York by the cynical, selfish and typically male showman Carl Denham (Eric William Morris) \u2014 has escaped from the theater where he\u2019s been put on exploitative display, she sings a battle hymn of sympathy to him. (\u201cFrom birth we\u2019ve both been playing a game we cannot win / We\u2019ll never break the lock or ever leave the box the world has put us in.\u201d) GREEN A car wreck of clich\u00e9s like that simply can\u2019t put a feminist story across meaningfully. Or any story, really \u2014 and that\u2019s a bigger problem than the bad score and sluggish 20-foot marionette. I find it hard to believe that the book is by Jack Thorne, who won a Tony Award last season for writing \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child.\u201d BRANTLEY Yes, but as far as I can tell, the story \u2014 and the music and the gymnastic dancing \u2014 are basically just filler until Kong shows up again and looks noble and sorrowful and, occasionally (when Peter Mumford\u2019s lighting is really low), menacing. Didn\u2019t you sense the live performers knew they weren\u2019t the main attraction? GREEN Mr. McOnie certainly had them working frantically. During the musical numbers, which feel relentless, the ensemble comes off as a troupe of overstimulated mimes playing charades. But here\u2019s my question for you: Was there anything, aside from Kong\u2019s two or three expressions, you actually enjoyed? BRANTLEY Not really. I kept hoping a higher camp factor might kick in. When poor Ann is taken to Kong\u2019s lair, and makes quips about his housekeeping and bachelor ways, I longed for the reincarnation of Madeline Kahn, who made such blissful hay out of similar material in \u201cYoung Frankenstein.\u201d GREEN The camp here is all accidental. The Skull Island jungle looks like green spaghetti with phlegm balls. (The scenic and projection designer is Peter England.) But the oppressiveness of the music and the over-intensity of the staging never allow you to laugh at, and therefore enjoy, the ludicrousness of the story. BRANTLEY Agreed. By the way, if you look at accounts of the Australian incarnation of five years ago, which had a book by Craig Lucas, it featured several more characters, including a love interest for Ann. In this version, there are effectively three central human characters: the agency-seeking Ann; the chauvinist, bad-mogul Carl; and (oh, dear) his put-upon, slow-witted, golden-hearted assistant, Lumpy (Erik Lochtefeld). GREEN The bevy of previous authors discarded in the course of the musical\u2019s development dodged a bullet here. But Mr. Lochtefeld actually manages to give a sincere and human-scale performance, even if most of what he has to say is maudlin hogwash. BRANTLEY Yes, even the screams lacked eloquence. Fay Wray, the star of the original, is best remembered for her earsplitting howls of terror when she\u2019s in the big guy\u2019s clutches. But our intrepid Ann is incapable of screaming in fear. Instead, she roars, and that\u2019s what attracts her soul mate Kong to her. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t hear a lot of Katy Perry power in Ms. Pitts\u2019s scream. GREEN Perhaps we are mistaken in applying arty standards to the cynical product of an ambitious entertainment company that made its name on animatronic arena shows. Character logic may not matter here as much as the intermission sales of the Kongopolitan (vodka, triple sec, cranberry juice and a splash of lime). I looked in vain for the Kong-branded Thorazine. BRANTLEY Gee, Jesse, it\u2019s enough to make even you long for a margarita, with Jimmy Buffett melodies on the side.

{"content": "LONDON \u2014 A lawn at the Olympic Park in London has taken on the appearance of a mass, open-air graveyard, with tens of thousands of shrouded figures laid out in neat rows \u2014 one of Europe\u2019s many commemorations of this weekend\u2019s centennial of the end of World War I. The figures, each the size of a child\u2019s doll, make up an art installation called \u201cShrouds of the Somme\u201d that went on display at the park on Thursday, symbolizing the 72,396 British and Commonwealth servicemen who died on the Somme battlefields in France from 1916 to 1918 and who had no known graves. The British artist Rob Heard spent five years hand-sewing calico shrouds to the thousands of small figures so that the bodies of the soldiers could symbolically be laid to rest on British soil in time for the anniversary on Sunday of Armistice Day. At first, \u201cI focused on 19,240, the number killed on just the first day of the Battle of the Somme,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to count the number out loud, but ran out of steam at 1,500.\u201d \u201cI realized how difficult it was to visualize these huge numbers and thought through ways I could physically represent them,\u201d he added. The main Battle of the Somme, initially a joint British-French offensive against German armies in northern France, came to represent the brutal futility of what became known as the Great War, achieving little but mechanized slaughter. It lasted for more than five months and became one of the worst battles in history, killing or wounding more than one million soldiers but barely moving the front lines. The first day of the clash, July 1, 1916, remains by far the bloodiest day in British military history, leaving 19,240 British and Commonwealth troops dead and twice as many wounded. (By comparison, in the deadliest single day for American forces, at the Battle of Antietam in 1862, during the Civil War, the death toll for both sides combined was less than 4,000.) Mr. Heard said he had started to think about the loss and impact of war in 2013 after he got into a car accident and lost mobility, hindering his ability to carry out his work carving the fanciful wooden edifices he calls Bough Houses. He said he had become increasingly depressed but had later realized that some of the British soldiers returning from war in Afghanistan were far worse off. He then started considering previous wars, he said, and became fascinated by shrouded figures and ways that they might be used to represent the dead. \u201cIt was very important that one person created these figures, that it didn\u2019t become a factory line,\u201d he said. \u201cThat person just happened to be me. One day I wasn\u2019t making them and the next I was, and once I had started I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d Mr. Heard has spent over 13,000 hours in a shed at the bottom of his garden in southwest England, stitching shrouds onto the plastic figures. The initial installation featured 19,240 figures and went on display in 2016 to mark the anniversary of the first day of the battle. It received more than 60,000 visitors, including family members of some of the men who were killed a century earlier, and that inspired Mr. Heard, he said, to make more figures to represent all the men whose bodies had not been recovered. Jake Moores, the chairman of the \u201cShrouds of the Somme\u201d project, said in a statement during the opening of the installation that, \u201cBringing the individual to the forefront of these unimaginable numbers will help the nation to truly understand the scale of the loss of those who gave their all.\u201d The installation will be on display in London until Nov. 18.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/world/europe/world-war-i-shrouds-london.html", "date": "2018-11-09 00:00:00", "author": "By Ceylan Yeginsu", "description": "The display of 72,396 shrouds, dedicated to soldiers killed in France on the battlefields of the Somme, is tied to the 100th anniversary of the war\u2019s armistice.", "title": "A Somber World War I Memorial in London Seeks to Finally Lay the Fallen to Rest"},
{"content": "NORTH OGDEN, Utah \u2014 The call had come again. Brent Taylor, the mayor of North Ogden and a major in the Utah National Guard, would be going to Afghanistan for his fourth deployment. He told his constituents about it on Facebook in January, leaning into the camera to explain that he had been called to serve his country \u201cwhenever and however I can\u201d and that he would be gone for a year, as part of a team helping to train an Afghan Army commando battalion. \u201cService is really what leadership is all about,\u201d he told them. [Read: The wife of Major Taylor on the return of his remains.]  He said goodbye to his wife, Jennie, and their seven children, and turned over his municipal duties to his friend Brent Chugg. \u201cYou need to keep safe,\u201d Mr. Chugg told him. \u201cI will,\u201d Major Taylor replied. He did not make it home. Major Taylor, 39, was killed on Saturday in an insider attack, apparently by one of the people he was there to help. The Pentagon did not say right away who had been killed. But the news that it was Brent Taylor was soon all over Utah, relayed in expressions of remorse by politicians and civic leaders. In a nation already riven with anxiety over a heated midterm election, a synagogue mass shooting and high-profile bomb scares, Major Taylor\u2019s death and the wounding of another service member in the same attack sent up a fresh wave of grief. It was a brutal reminder of a 17-year-old war that has carved gaping holes in communities across the country, with little end in sight. His death hit particularly hard in Utah, where a widely shared Mormon faith binds many of its three million residents in a way that is rare for the modern era. On Saturday, when Mr. Chugg arrived at the home of Jennie Taylor, they embraced and she began to sob. [Get a weekly roundup of Times coverage of war delivered to your inbox. Sign up here.] \u201cWe are overwhelmed with heartache, but not regret,\u201d Ms. Taylor\u2019s sister, Kristy Pack, said on Sunday, standing outside the modest brick house. Even though Major Taylor died in a suspected insider attack, Ms. Pack said, \u201cin our view there is not a whole lot of room for anger.\u201d Ms. Taylor now faces the task of raising the couple\u2019s children: Megan, 13; Lincoln, 11; Alex, 9; Jacob 7; Ellie, 5; Jonathan, 2; and Caroline, 11 months. At a news conference at the Utah National Guard headquarters outside Salt Lake City, Gov. Gary R. Herbert said he knew Major Taylor personally, calling him \u201cthe personification of love of God, family and country.\u201d Governor Herbert said he knew that some friends had tried to persuade Major Taylor not to return to Afghanistan, arguing that he had done enough for his country. But Major Taylor wanted to go, the governor said, and had his wife\u2019s support for the decision, because he loved the people of Afghanistan and thought he could do some good there. A Utah law permits elected officials who belong to the Reserves or the National Guard, like Major Taylor did, to retain their civilian posts while deployed by temporarily ceding authority to a surrogate. North Ogden is a middle-class suburb of about 19,000 people north of Salt Lake City at the foot of the Wasatch Range. On Sunday, residents rose at dawn to carry American flags on towering poles through the foggy streets, driving them into the cold ground along the road to City Hall. Then they dispersed to the many churches in the town, where they bowed their heads as their leaders called on \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d to pray for Brother Taylor and his family. It happened to be a Fast Sunday, when Mormons skip meals and donate food to the hungry. At one service, somber boys in crisp white shirts circled the pews with the sacrament. \u201cI just don\u2019t know of a finer man,\u201d said Clark Skeen, a resident of North Ogden. Major Taylor, who grew up in Arizona, enlisted in the military after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. So did his five brothers. Before his last tour, he had served twice in Iraq and once in Afghanistan. He joined the City Council in 2009, was chosen as mayor in 2013 and was re-elected in 2017, building a reputation as a hands-on leader and careful listener, someone who would be seen in the streets before dawn to direct snow plows on stormy days. Mr. Chugg said that as mayor, Major Taylor was dogged in pursuit of city improvements, building an amphitheater, a public works building and new roads. Other city officials, he said, had been satisfied with the status quo: \u201cNot Mayor Taylor.\u201d A small memorial began to form on Sunday outside City Hall, below a soggy American flag lowered to half-staff. One woman, Deborah Eddy, 63, dropped off a bright yellow lily in a flowerpot. Another, Judy Viskoe, 36, stood by, gripping a black umbrella. \u201cI cried all day yesterday,\u201d Ms. Viskoe said. \u201cI don\u2019t politically align with him. He\u2019s a Republican. But I noticed in his running of this town that he treated everyone with respect, and he listened, and he didn\u2019t bring his politics into the mix. He\u2019s just unlike any other mayor I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d The number of American troops in Afghanistan has fallen to fewer than 14,000 in 2018, from about 100,000 in 2011, when American forces were still officially engaged in a combat mission there. All but a few large bases have been shuttered, and the main role of the remaining American troops is to advise and train Afghan forces, not fight the Taliban themselves. The change in mission has also changed the mix of troops who are in harm\u2019s way. The Americans who are training Afghan troops are often older, higher-ranking and more experienced than before. And those are the troops who, being surrounded by armed Afghans, tend to face the biggest risk from insider attacks, a persistent threat in the country. Nearly half of the American combat deaths in Afghanistan this year have come in suspected insider attacks. Together, those trends have led to a steady climb in the average age and rank of American casualties. Since the draft ended in 1973, it has also become increasingly common for siblings to serve in the military, like Major Taylor and his brothers. Researchers say that having a parent or sibling in uniform increases the likelihood that someone will join up, and so does coming from a large family. This spring, quadruplets from Michigan all enlisted, each in a different branch of the armed forces. Major Taylor\u2019s body is scheduled to arrive at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday at 9:45 p.m. Members of his family and representatives of the Utah National Guard are expected to be on hand. \u201cUtah weeps for them today,\u201d Lt. Gov. Spencer J. Cox wrote on Facebook after receiving word of the major\u2019s death. \u201cThis war has once again cost us the best blood of a generation.\u201d When Major Taylor left North Ogden in January, hundreds of residents lined the street to see him off, and the local police gave him an escort. \u201cRight now there is a need for my experience and skills to serve in our nation\u2019s long-lasting war in Afghanistan,\u201d he wrote at the time, adding that his work would fulfill President Trump\u2019s order to expand the capabilities of the Afghan forces. Rather than disappear into a war zone, Major Taylor kept up a steady stream of Facebook posts while he was deployed, connecting his community to a conflict that is off the radar of many Americans. In what turned out to be his final public post, on Oct. 28, he tapped out a message about the recent Afghan election. \u201cIt was beautiful to see over 4 million Afghan men and women brave threats and deadly attacks to vote in Afghanistan\u2019s first parliamentary elections in eight years,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMany American, NATO allies, and Afghan troops have died to make moments like this possible.\u201d Then he turned to his own country. \u201cAs the USA gets ready to vote in our own election next week, I hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd that whether the Republicans or the Democrats win, that we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.\u201d He concluded: \u201cGod Bless America. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/us/utah-mayor-killed-afghanistan-brent-taylor.html", "date": "2018-11-04 00:00:00", "author": "By Julie Turkewitz", "description": "Major Taylor, who died Saturday in an apparent insider attack, was helping train Afghan troops and staying in touch with his North Ogden constituents on social media.", "title": "Brent Taylor, Utah Mayor Killed in Afghanistan, Was on 4th Deployment"},
{"content": "They were the states that broke Democratic hearts the last time \u2014 and the ones where any political comeback would have to begin. So how did the Democrats do on Tuesday in 2016 Trump country? They won. They also lost. And both experiences are instructive for the party\u2019s future. This year, The New York Times focused on seven states where Democrats hoped to dig out after losses two years ago. Some were traditionally blue areas, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Some were clear reaches, like Texas and Tennessee. Read the start of the series here. Here\u2019s a look at how the party fared: Rebuilding the \u201cblue wall\u201d that President Trump breached was always going to start here. Read the story:  Trump Won Pennsylvania. Democrats Want the State (and His Voters) Back. Even after the president\u2019s victory, Pennsylvania Democrats seemed well positioned to win re-election in contests for governor and the Senate, with relatively popular incumbents (Gov. Tom Wolf and Senator Bob Casey) and weak opponents. And win they did, easily. The biggest test was in the House. Democrats passed that one, too, picking up several seats under a redrawn district map. Of particular interest were two races in districts that Mr. Trump carried in 2016 \u2014 a proving ground for Democrats eager to demonstrate that the state can be theirs again in 2020. They won both by comfortable margins, sending Conor Lamb and Matt Cartwright back to Congress. Mr. Lamb, who won a special election in March in a deep-red western Pennsylvania district, provided an early template for how to win in Trump country. An affable former Marine who focused on labor rights and economic fairness, Mr. Lamb took care not to alienate Trump voters by antagonizing the president. Mr. Cartwright, running in northeastern Pennsylvania, was likewise committed to understanding conservative constituents. He said he had taken up deer hunting as a point of bonding. The pair will be joined in Congress by several Pennsylvania women who won on Tuesday, including Madeleine Dean, Chrissy Houlahan and Mary Gay Scanlon in suburban Philadelphia, and Susan Wild in the Lehigh Valley. Senator Ted Cruz was cocky. \u201cThis is Texas,\u201d he swaggered at campaign events, suggesting it was folly to think that his Democratic opponent, Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, could change the makeup of the state\u2019s electorate through sheer force of personality and progressivism. \u201cPerhaps in Massachusetts,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in an interview in August, sipping a Texas-brewed beer at a bar outside Houston. Read the story: Beto O\u2019Rourke Dreams of One Texas. Ted Cruz Sees Another Clearly. In the end, both candidates were right. Mr. Cruz survived on Tuesday with an emphasis on cultural conservatism and a spirited defense of Mr. Trump, his former rival in the 2016 presidential primaries. And Mr. O\u2019Rourke turned out a remarkable number of voters \u2014 more than 4 million, about three percentage points behind Mr. Cruz \u2014 proving that a different kind of Democratic campaign could make the party competitive in Texas. His strength around some of the state\u2019s major population centers also helped lift congressional candidates in key battlegrounds. Still, the way forward for Democrats in statewide races there is uncertain. It is hard to imagine future candidates replicating many of the forces that powered Mr. O\u2019Rourke: his charisma and viral status on social media; his prolific fund-raising; an opponent like Mr. Cruz, who can be polarizing even within his own party. And Mr. O\u2019Rourke still lost. Yet even before he had, the calls for a 2020 presidential candidacy were well underway. They will not soon stop. Few losses were more alarming for Democrats in 2016 than this one. On Tuesday, there was redemption, mostly. With a focus on recapturing union voters who were often cool to Hillary Clinton two years ago, Michigan Democrats saw their emphasis on lunch-pail economic issues rewarded this week with decisive wins in a governor\u2019s race (Gretchen Whitmer), a Senate re-election (Debbie Stabenow) and several down-ballot contests. Read the story:  In Michigan, Female Candidates Target a Key Trump Bloc: Union Voters But Republicans\u2019 deepest fears on Tuesday were not realized. Democrats had hoped to flip enough local seats to take control of the State Legislature. They fell short. Still, the results seemed to suggest that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s visceral appeal to some labor households, his success in 2016 had quite a bit to do with the unpopularity of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe got a lot of pushback on Hillary,\u201d Bill Black, a leader of the Teamsters union in Michigan, said months ago, sizing up the contest for governor. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing that with Gretchen.\u201d At last, the Democrats got their man. Scott Walker, for years an avatar of the Republican dominance of state-level politics across the Midwest, will be governor no more. He lost, narrowly, to Tony Evers, the state\u2019s schools superintendent. Read the story: Democrats Want to Beat Scott Walker. But the Wisconsin Economy Is a Hurdle. The Democratic campaign message in Wisconsin in many ways mirrored the party\u2019s argument nationally, with a focus on health care, education and infrastructure spending. But Mr. Walker, despite presiding over a strong economy, proved particularly vulnerable to these kinds of attacks: He had pushed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and overseen steep cuts in education spending early in his tenure. Elsewhere on the ticket, Senator Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic incumbent, won re-election by double digits. But Republicans in the state seem disinclined to cede power without a fight. Leaders in the legislature are already discussing ways to limit Mr. Evers\u2019s authority before he is sworn in. Democrats had hoped that their unlikely path back to a Senate majority would run through this right-leaning Southern state with a reputation for elevating pragmatists over ideologues. They assumed that their nominee, the former Gov. Phil Bredesen, was a good fit, more stylistically equivalent to the Republican he was running to replace, Senator Bob Corker, than the Republican nominee herself \u2014 Marsha Blackburn, a hard-line conservative. Read the story: A Changing Tennessee Weighs a Moderate or Conservative for Senate It did not matter. Ms. Blackburn won easily, suggesting that the state will not be particularly hospitable to Democrats any time soon. Mr. Bredesen won all 95 counties in the state when he was re-elected as governor in 2006. If he could not keep a race close \u2014 after coming out in support of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, after speaking warmly of gun rights \u2014 it is hard to envision another Democrat faring much better. \u201cIn our mind we think we\u2019re a little more progressive, a little more advanced,\u201d Raumesh Akbari, a Democratic state legislator in Memphis, said of Tennessee before the election, comparing it to other reliably red states. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know.\u201d In 2016, Mr. Trump effectively took this once-purple state off the board, winning by eight points. Tuesday\u2019s results make it clear he should enter 2020 as a strong favorite again. Despite high hopes among Democrats who thought they might flip several statewide offices, Republicans had a very good night, starting at the top of the ticket. Mike DeWine, currently the attorney general, was elected governor, turning back Richard Cordray, the Democratic nominee who had led the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Read the story: \u2018When You Think You\u2019ve Got It Figured Out, It Flips\u2019: Democrats Puzzle Over Retaking Ohio In defeat, Mr. Cordray won more votes than the incumbent, Gov. John R. Kasich, earned in either of his victories \u2014 and still lost to Mr. DeWine by more than four points. The outcome was sobering for Democrats. Mr. Trump\u2019s success in once solidly blue corners of the state, particularly with many old-guard union voters, seemed to carry over at least in part to Republicans in a nonpresidential year. And Mr. Cordray was never going to approach the kinds of numbers that President Barack Obama enjoyed with young and African-American voters when he won the state in his two campaigns. \u201cDonald Trump has completely disintegrated the old Democratic coalition in Ohio,\u201d said Michael Hartley, a longtime adviser to Republican campaigns in the state. \u201cAnd I think to a lot of people\u2019s surprise, the Trump voters came out.\u201d Oh, Florida. Going into Tuesday, Democrats had constructed a sort of lab experiment for their party\u2019s future: Their candidate for governor, Andrew Gillum, was a young African-American progressive who had electrified liberals across the country. Their candidate for the Senate, Bill Nelson, was seeking re-election as a white septuagenarian centrist who joined Congress the year Mr. Gillum was born. Read the story: A Centrist and a Liberal Test Florida, and Democrats Everywhere Watch Closely Polls generally showed Mr. Gillum with a small lead over his Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, a hard-line Trump supporter, leaving Democrats hopeful that the enthusiasm around his campaign might be enough to lift Mr. Nelson in his race against Gov. Rick Scott. It seems safe to say this did not happen as planned. It does not seem safe to say who won. While Democrats appeared to lose both races on Tuesday night, the margins have shriveled enough in recent days to dip below the threshold for a recount. Republicans have expressed confidence that their apparent wins will remain wins.

{"content": "CRAVING By Esther GerritsenTranslated by Michele Hutchison 192 pp. World Editions. Paper, $15.99.  THE BUS ON THURSDAY By Shirley Barrett 304 pp. MCD x FSG. Paper, $15. There\u2019s no right way to deal with cancer. But somehow, there seem like a million wrong ways, especially if you\u2019re a woman. When the NBC News correspondent Betty Rollin wrote her groundbreaking breast-cancer memoir, \u201cFirst, You Cry,\u201d critics called her narcissistic for worrying about how her breasts would look post-mastectomy. The Vatican called assisted suicide \u201can absurdity\u201d after Brittany Maynard chose to end her own life rather than succumb painfully to brain cancer. When Nora Ephron died from pneumonia brought on by acute myeloid leukemia, the gossip writer Liz Smith called her a \u201ccontrol freak\u201d for not telling friends that she was sick. It\u2019s not exactly news that women are often unfairly judged \u2014 sometimes by other women \u2014 for not putting their loved ones\u2019 needs before their own. But when you\u2019re talking about women who are terminally ill, the whole thing is just bizarre. Here they are, dying, and they\u2019re supposed to focus on how to make everyone else more comfortable? What a relief, then, to read two new funny, angry, feminist novels that give women with cancer the freedom to behave in the way that\u2019s right for them \u2014 even if that way is badly. In \u201cCraving,\u201d written by the Dutch novelist Esther Gerritsen and translated by Michele Hutchison, Elisabeth de Wit reveals her illness to her daughter, Coco, \u201cat the wrong time, in the wrong place, in the wrong clothes.\u201d She stops Coco as she\u2019s cycling down a busy road and \u201csmiles like a person about to tell a joke\u201d before blurting out the news. Elisabeth seems to have an inappropriate response for everything. In one scene, Coco tries to get closure from her dying mother about her childhood, when Elisabeth would lock her in a room for days while she cried. \u201cDarling, you don\u2019t have to feel guilty about it,\u201d Elisabeth replies. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t help it!\u201d Is this scene meant to be funny, or disturbing, or both? It takes work to figure out how to read \u201cCraving,\u201d just as it takes work to read Elisabeth herself, but that work is extremely rewarding. Gerritsen\u2019s stark prose leaves a lot of space for interpreting and reinterpreting Elisabeth\u2019s tone and motivations, which feels generous, both to the reader and to the characters. Coco\u2019s boyfriend, Hans, is quick to diagnose Elisabeth with autism. But when he asks if Elisabeth has trouble putting herself in others\u2019 shoes, Elisabeth suggests that Hans is the one with that problem. This feels like a warning to all the Hanses out there: Before you judge these characters, check your own empathy levels. \u201cCraving\u201d ends up offering some deep insights into the ways women process emotions \u2014 or fail to process them \u2014 during difficult times. Coco confuses love with hunger, and hunger with panic, leading her to a cycle of binge-eating and reckless sex as her mother gets weaker. What Coco and her mother feel is always refracted through what others expect them to feel, as good mothers and daughters and women. \u201cElisabeth wants to help her daughter,\u201d Gerritsen writes. \u201cShe has to want to.\u201d It\u2019s hard to tell if Elisabeth understands the difference. Feeling responsible for other people\u2019s happiness makes it exhausting for Elisabeth to even communicate with her family. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever read a novel that captures the emotional labor of people-pleasing language quite so well. When Coco talks to Elisabeth about death, Elisabeth tries to brighten the mood with \u201clight words\u201d like \u201cjust a sec, a sandwich, abracadabra.\u201d There\u2019s a funny moment where Elisabeth notices that her husband, during drunken sex, speaks only in aaba rhyme schemes. Later he confesses to an affair, and she can\u2019t help internalizing the language he prefers, her shock and grief unfolding in an aaba scheme in her mind. Even as the book reaches its inevitable conclusion, Elisabeth talks to herself in painfully upbeat language, using phrases like whoops-a-daisy! as she approaches her own death. Droll and horrific and incredibly moving, the ending makes you feel the full weight of those \u201clight words.\u201d In \u201cThe Bus on Thursday,\u201d a comedic horror novel by the Australian writer Shirley Barrett, the narrator is enraged by the burden of putting others at ease. From the moment Eleanor Mellett gets her first mammogram, she\u2019s criticized for not being \u201crelaxed enough.\u201d By the time she\u2019s gone through a mastectomy and joined a support group, she\u2019s crafting furious blog posts about the pressure to remain optimistic: \u201cIf they are nudging you toward the scrapbooking table, then it is basically code for, \u2018You will die soon, so quick! Throw some photos in an album as a keepsake for your loved ones. Make sure you are smiling in these photos and have lots of hair. Decorate with butterfly stickers and inspirational quotes about dancing like nobody\u2019s watching, etc.\u2019\u201d The whole novel is written in what Eleanor calls \u201cfunny-angry\u201d blog posts, which might be why the jacket copy pitches the book as \u201c\u2018Bridget Jones\u2019 meets \u2018The Exorcist.\u2019\u201d But it\u2019s closer to a fun, campy Tim Burton movie. Hoping for a fresh start during recovery, Eleanor takes a job at a school in Talbingo, a remote Australian town with no cellphone reception (uh oh) where a beloved teacher has disappeared. Here, she encounters a friar who looks like a praying mantis, a vacuum cleaner salesman who\u2019s almost supernaturally attractive, a mysterious 1960s power station, a paranormal bus, and a severed hand that appears to have a life of its own. If that sounds surreal, well, so does the experience of having cancer. Barrett also works as a screenwriter and filmmaker, so it\u2019s no surprise that she\u2019s a masterly world-builder. As Talbingo becomes more and more vivid, Eleanor gets increasingly unhinged, to the point where she\u2019s actively testing the limits of our sympathy. One of the funniest moments finds her giving a graphic talk about death to children; one of the most unsettling ones involves a child, too, but it\u2019s probably best left unspoiled here. Throughout the book, you\u2019ll be forgiven for wondering if Eleanor is a survivor in the crazy-making world of cancer recovery \u2014 or if she\u2019s just crazy. There are no definitive answers in the sure-to-be-polarizing ending, which might leave some puzzled about the larger points that Barrett is trying to make. When I first finished \u201cThe Bus on Thursday,\u201d I threw it down in frustration, only to pick it back up and reread the final pages. Now, I wonder if the lack of some profound ending is deliberate. \u201cThis is the problem with having cancer: Everyone expects you to have mysteriously acquired some kind of wisdom out of the experience, and if you haven\u2019t, then it\u2019s a personal failing,\u201d Eleanor writes early in the book. Maybe Barrett doesn\u2019t owe us any revelations beyond this one: Don\u2019t trust a cancer novel that can be wrapped up neatly with butterfly stickers and inspirational quotes.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/books/review/craving-esther-gerritsen-bus-thursday-shirley-barrett.html", "date": "2018-11-09 00:00:00", "author": "By Melissa Maerz", "description": "Women, even dying women, are often judged for putting their own needs first.

{"content": "MONTREAL \u2014 Canada is running low on legal pot three weeks after sales of recreational marijuana were authorized, a shortage that is sending some frustrated consumers back to the black market. At least three provinces \u2014 Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick \u2014 are facing a dearth of legal marijuana and two of them have seen outlets selling cannabis temporarily shut down for lack of supply. \u201cWe need more weed!\u201d said Trevor Tobin, who teamed up with his mother to open a marijuana retailer called High North in Labrador City, Newfoundland, a small mining town near the Quebec border. He said his suppliers did not grow enough plants and don\u2019t have enough packaging equipment. \u201cIt is the law of supply and demand,\u201d Mr. Tobin said. The shortage threatens to undermine a major aim of legalization: to tame an illegal marijuana trade estimated at about 5.3 billion Canadian dollars annually. Angry consumers across the country say they are returning to their illegal dealers. In Montreal, several pot smokers said their illegal dealers were taking advantage of the shortage by hawking home delivery services and lowering prices. Retailers, consumers and the producers themselves say they are exasperated by the shortage, which is being blamed at least partly on the unexpected explosion of demand for government-approved marijuana and the slow pace at which the federal government has licensed cannabis producers. Of the 132 producers approved by the government to supply marijuana to retailers, 78 have received sales licenses, according to Health Canada, the government department responsible for public health. \u201cWe are building a new legal industry that wasn\u2019t there three weeks ago, and we knew there would be problems,\u201d said Mathieu Gaudreault, a spokesman for Quebec\u2019s cannabis agency. He said demand had outstripped supply, while licensed producers had overestimated their capacity. \u201cProducers can add more people to try and meet demand,\u201d Mr. Gaudreault said. \u201cBut that won\u2019t make the plants grow any faster.\u201d On Monday, New Brunswick became the latest province to confront a shortage as Cannabis NB, the provincial government agency charged with selling marijuana, temporarily closed half of its 20 stores, citing a production bottleneck. After about 20 percent of its first order was delivered, it said it was waiting for more marijuana deliveries to help plug the gap. That followed the decision by Quebec\u2019s provincial cannabis agency to shutter its 12 cannabis outlets three days a week until the supply can be replenished. [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] In Ontario, some frustrated pot smokers say they have returned to their illegal dealers. The Ontario Cannabis Store, the government retailer, received 150,000 orders in its first week of business and has been struggling to keep up with soaring demand. The problems have been exacerbated by a postal strike. \u201cThe government is just feeding the black market and our customers are going there,\u201d said Mr. Tobin, the shopkeeper. \u201cWe are called High North. But legal weed is in such short supply that no one is getting high on it.\u201d Mr. Tobin said that after opening the store on Oct. 17, the day of legalization, his entire marijuana supply sold out in four hours. Among the items flying off the shelves were a potent sativa strain that gives people a \u201ccreative and social buzz,\u201d and pre-rolled joints, he said. After waiting two weeks to get a new cannabis shipment, he said he had been forced to shutter the store for a week. He said he and his mother had invested about 100,000 Canadian dollars in the shop and were struggling to pay their bills. His suppliers, who are licensed by the provincial government, had told him that they had underestimated demand. The store, which has now reopened, is trying to scrape by with the sales of paraphernalia like bongs and rolling papers. But Mr. Tobin said it was not enough for the business to be profitable. His mother, Brenda Tobin, added that demand for government cannabis had surpassed expectations, in part because of the novelty but also because consumers were drawn by government marijuana being strictly regulated and free from contaminants found in some street marijuana. \u201cPeople know what they are getting, and they like that,\u201d she said. Andr\u00e9 Gagnon, a spokesman for Health Canada, which is regulating the industry, said that Oct. 17 \u201cmarked the end of nearly a century of criminal prohibition of cannabis and the launch of an entirely new regulated industry in our country.\u201d \u201cAs with any new industry where there is considerable consumer demand, we expect there may be periods where inventories of some products run low or, in some cases, run out,\u201d he said in a statement. Given that marijuana had been illegal for so long, he added, the government didn\u2019t have a reliable benchmark to know which products would be in high demand or to be able to estimate the demand level. Producers, for their part, say that mastering a new industry invariably means a steep learning curve. In the run-up to legalization, Aphria, a cannabis producer in Ontario, said it had been forced to dispose of 13,642 plants after a lack of qualified local labor hobbled its harvesting. Vic Neufeld, the company\u2019s chief executive, predicted in October that there would be shortages and that the problem would improve when consumer demand was better understood. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to merge a five-lane highway into a one-lane country road,\u201c he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to get everything through the bottleneck on a timely basis.\u201d Mandesh Dosanjh, chief executive of Pure Sunfarms, a licensed cannabis producer based in British Columbia, said that shortages were not surprising given that producers were grappling with challenges such as mastering the growing of cannabis on a large scale, creating new supply chains across different provinces and allowing for rigorous and time-consuming inspections by Health Canada inspectors. \u201cIt\u2019s early days,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find know-how in an industry that was prohibited.\u201d Adam Greenblatt, a spokesman for Canopy Growth, one of the largest cannabis producers in the country, said the company was still building greenhouses in British Columbia, as it sought to accommodate a burgeoning market. Small things such as running out of the glue for the excise tax stamps required on every package of cannabis were causing some producers to have bottlenecks. \u201cEveryone is doing their best to meet demand,\u201d he said. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought that weed would be this popular?\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/world/canada/canada-marijuana-shortage.html", "date": "2018-11-07 00:00:00", "author": "By Dan Bilefsky", "description": "\u201cWe need more weed!\u201d a shopkeeper lamented.

Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi in 1961\u2019s \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d stumbling around his Manhattan apartment in a blue bathrobe, his face contorted \u2014 lips barely closing over grotesquely pronounced buckteeth, slicked-back hair dyed jet black.

I, too, am half Chinese, though I have always been told (by other Chinese-Americans, by white people who were under the impression I was one of them) that I\u2019m not the right kind of Chinese. I\u2019m over six feet tall and my eyelids have creases, and I have come to anticipate the pause in a conversation with strangers as I watch them \u2014 like someone calculating the size of someone else\u2019s apartment \u2014 square the fact of my ethnicity with my appearance. I have never quite seen myself on-screen. Maybe in Keanu Reeves or Olivia Munn, but even so, the side of myself that is understood as Asian \u2014 that is seen \u2014 is as washed away as theirs, and that is because we live in a world that doesn\u2019t make time for ambiguity, that continues to reward whiteness with privilege. Having been raised on a mediocre diet of American television and mainstream Hollywood movies, I can count on one hand the actors of Asian descent who made an impression on me growing up. Their performances have stayed with me, like a novel you may never read again but pack with you every time you move. There are two I\u2019ll mention here. The first was George Takei, a Japanese-American, as the steadfast and levelheaded \u201cStar Trek\u201d officer Hikaru Sulu. He spoke \u2014 I remember finding this remarkable, and, in a way, I still do, given the show was created in 1966 \u2014 without an accent. In a subsequent feature-length film, Sulu eventually becomes captain of his own ship. He showed sound judgment and character in times of danger. He led. Then there was Sandra Oh, a Korean-Canadian, as the enraged Stephanie in 2004\u2019s \u201cSideways,\u201d who has a love affair with a feckless man named Jack, played by Thomas Haden Church. She breaks his nose after learning he is engaged to another woman; I had never seen a Korean woman on-screen lose her temper within the proximity of a Saab convertible and against the backdrop of a California vineyard. Her anger was justified. Her emotions were real, not cartoonish. Both performances let me understand that I didn\u2019t have to ask to assume the same privileges as those around me \u2014 but nor should I pretend to be someone I wasn\u2019t. They also spoke to a part of me, the Chinese half of me, that never felt it could behave as carelessly as the other half of me did. THERE HAVE BEEN attempts by Hollywood to insert real people of color \u2014 in this case, Asian-Americans \u2014 into the cultural landscape of film and television. Most recently, Daniel Wu was cast as Lu Ren in this year\u2019s \u201cTomb Raider,\u201d starring Alicia Vikander. He was as good-looking as he was complicated, but where typically there might have been some chemistry between two young and beautiful people embarking on a grand adventure, Wu was relegated by the end to the benign, if handsome, friend. The television reboot \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d has added more nuanced Asian characters who were missing from the original version, played by actors such as Grace Park, Daniel Dae Kim or Masi Oka, and newer creations, including \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d have cast Jimmy O. Yang and Kumail Nanjiani in stereotypical but still more rewardingly complex supporting roles (Yang plays a ruthless if talentless app developer; Nanjiani, as a software engineer, steals the scene in nearly every episode). But these are still small changes, and this so-called progress rings hollow. You remain unlikely to see Asian-Americans in lead roles in big studios films without the hint of tokenism, even after the box office success of this year\u2019s \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d the first studio film with an all-Asian cast since \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d in 1993. Representation of Asians within American performing arts has always been alarmingly small. A recent study by the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism showed Asian-Americans representing only 1 percent of all leading roles in Hollywood (the 2017 United States Census Bureau reported that there are 18 million Americans of Asian descent, or roughly 6 percent of the population). Only one actor of Asian heritage has ever won an Academy Award for best actor: Ben Kingsley, whose father was Indian, in 1983 for playing Gandhi (Kingsley has been nominated in three other instances). Twelve actors of Asian descent have ever received nominations from the academy \u2014 all largely for supporting roles, with the exception of Merle Oberon, who was half British and half Sri Lankan, in 1936. The others include the Japanese-American actor Pat Morita; the Cambodian actor Haing S. Ngor; the Japanese actors Mako Iwamatsu, Ken Watanabe, Rinko Kikuchi and Sessue Hayakawa; the Chinese-American actresses and sisters Jennifer and Meg Tilly; the Filipino-American actress Hailee Steinfeld; and the British-Indian actor Dev Patel. This year, Sandra Oh made history as the first woman of Asian descent to be nominated for an Emmy for the lead in a dramatic series, as Eve Polastri in \u201cKilling Eve.\u201d And earlier this year, the Indian-American actor Aziz Ansari was awarded best actor for a TV comedy by the Golden Globes, the first actor of Asian descent to do so. When \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d announced that the actor Awkwafina would host the show this past October, it was noted that the last woman of Asian descent to host was Lucy Liu in 2000, 18 years ago. The New York Times recently reported that in the search for the male lead in \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d one of the movie\u2019s producers was told by several prominent American theater schools that they hadn\u2019t had a male Asian graduate in years. A study by multiple universities reported that, over a one-year period, of the 242 scripted shows on broadcast, cable and streaming TV, just one-third had a series regular who was Asian-American or Pacific Islander. These are shows, mind you, set in cities such as San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, which all have significant Asian-American and Pacific Islander populations (33 percent, 12 percent and 24 percent, respectively). And another report by the U.S.C. Annenberg Inclusion Initiative stated that of the top 100 films of last year, 37 didn\u2019t include a single Asian character with a speaking role. Yet elsewhere in the arts, Asian-Americans have flourished: as poets, writers, directors, photographers, fashion designers, architects, interior decorators and visual artists. The creative offerings of Asian-Americans \u2014 from Vera Wang\u2019s fantasy wedding dresses to the fiction of Jhumpa Lahiri to the haunting cinematography of Hiro Murai, the director of Donald Glover\u2019s television show \u201cAtlanta\u201d \u2014 aren\u2019t just accepted but celebrated. Only in the representational arts do Asians remain unseen \u2014 mostly in film and television, but in music, too, and, to a lesser degree, on the runway. In other words: It is only when we are hidden that we are allowed to succeed. Which leads to a more troubling but inevitable conclusion: that there is something about the very physiognomy of the Asian face that American audiences still cannot or will not accept. EXOTIC, OPPORTUNISTIC prostitutes. Sexless, emasculated eunuchs. Submissive young girls. Savage, untamed creatures. Coolies. Filth. The earliest stereotypes about Asian-Americans were formed after the first wave of immigration in the mid-1800s, when Chinese immigrants were brought in by the thousands to help build the railroads that would eventually crisscross the western half of the nation. They were cheaper than American and European laborers, and they were made to work longer hours. But they were also hired because they were willing (though did they really have a choice?) to do the more dangerous work \u2014 clearing the path along perilous mountain ridges with dynamite, blowing up granite rock to create tunnels, often getting trapped inside mountains or swept away in avalanches \u2014 that others refused to do. Their arrival was called the Yellow Peril. Asian immigrants were seen as invasive and threatening to an entire American way of life, and over the next century, a series of laws were passed that excluded first the Chinese, but then also those from other Asian countries. By 1924, all Asian immigrants (with the exception of those from the Philippines, a country that had been annexed by the United States) were refused citizenship, naturalization, land ownership and, in some states, prevented from marrying those of another race. Hollywood capitalized on these fears accordingly in their creations of Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan. The former, a calculating villain who appeared in a series of films beginning in the 1920s (the name, invented by its British creator, is a crude jingoist rhyme, neither Mandarin nor Cantonese), is a mask of a Chinese man, always portrayed with crudely slanted eyes, eyebrows like caterpillars and a thin dangling beard. The latter was a benevolent but subservient detective in a bowler hat who was popularized by a series of white actors in dozens of films beginning in the 1920s and into the 1980s. And even if Asian men weren\u2019t portrayed as the yellow-faced villain or the neutered helpmate, they were still always the other. As with almost any reviled minority group in America, the fear traces back to sex \u2014 the men were either sexless or sex-crazed. The women were conniving dragon ladies or docile concubines. It was only in 1965, when immigration laws changed again, and the United States eliminated national-origin quotas and introduced a preference system based on family relationships as well as skills, that a new wave of Asian immigrants arrived. With them came a new stereotype, one that persists today: the model minority \u2014 competitive, goal-oriented and hard-working (but, notably, lacking in creativity, charm, sex appeal and humor). A recent lawsuit against Harvard University revealed how it systematically discriminates against Asian-American applicants, alleging that though Asian-American students consistently performed higher than other applicants when it came to test scores, grades and extracurriculars, they were consistently given lower scores for \u201cpositive personality,\u201d likability, courage, kindness and being \u201cwidely respected,\u201d according to the 160,000 student records included in the lawsuit\u2019s filing. (Harvard has denied the charges.) Inscrutable. High-achieving. Soulless. Why is it that the challenges of becoming part of a new country, of overcoming an immense language barrier or working twice as hard and twice as long are so rarely prized? I think often of the leap, for example, my mother made immigrating to this country from Taiwan, and how much she lost in translation. It\u2019s the little things you forget to explain or can\u2019t, at least right away, put into words. For years, my mother would tell me she was afraid of snakes, and I never understood why until we visited the house where she grew up in Keelung, a port city in northern Taiwan where the weather can shift in an instant, blue sky darkening to black. There, alongside a small garden, was a creek, and as we passed it, my mother remarked that that was where the bodies of dead snakes accumulated after each typhoon. The Chinese-American writer Weike Wang\u2019s short story \u201cOmakase,\u201d published this year in The New Yorker, captures this cultural muteness as well. In it, a young Chinese-American woman goes on a date with her white boyfriend to a sushi restaurant in Harlem. His relative ease in the restaurant and in his interactions with the Japanese chef show, on the one hand, a charismatic personality. But on the other, it reveals a white man\u2019s assumption of being understood, in being welcome. It causes, at one point, the protagonist to reflect on an earlier moment when she introduced her boyfriend to her parents: It\u2019s an obvious but understated point \u2014 the lack of charisma and expression that the protagonist\u2019s father possesses in English is not because he is a humorless and charmless man, but that the nuances of such expression are not, at that moment, available to him. It calls to mind the coded language used to describe Asians and Asian-Americans: \u201chard-working\u201d instead of brilliant, \u201cdiligent\u201d but not dazzling, \u201cfocused\u201d but not naturally gifted. But even if we can prove to you that we are as good as you, the underlying message we get from the culture is that there is something else that separates us, some quality that\u2019s impossible to quantify \u2014 originality, spark, winsome impulsivity, intuition. We are tireless workers, but all that diligence amounts to in the eyes of others is a kind of empty ambition. We don\u2019t seduce, we don\u2019t inspire, we don\u2019t go by our gut. These are skills the American workplace fetishizes, and it has been decided that we don\u2019t possess them. Recent studies have found that Asian-Americans are the least likely of all races to be promoted into managerial positions. The bamboo ceiling. And so it all comes back to how we are allowed to see ourselves on the screen: worker bees but not the inventor. Comical helpmeets but never the alpha. Filial sons and daughters who have abandoned emotional fulfillment in order to satisfy our parents. These stereotypes are, not incidentally, the absolute inverse of the types and tropes celebrated in American cinema: the rebel, the bad boy, the iconoclast, the prankster. The people we worship in our popular culture \u2014 from James Dean to Steve Jobs, Marilyn Monroe to Princess Diana \u2014 don\u2019t play by the rules. It\u2019s a Western myth that those we love distinguish themselves by their differences, that their faults are their virtues. Asians are seen differently: pathetic perfectionists who never got the meaning of life, who\u2019re unable to live with abandon and therefore with romance. And that is why we will never be compelling enough to be the hero in your eyes.  IN WATCHING MOVIES, we project. It\u2019s a basic impulse. We identify with who we see. We feel what the characters feel, perhaps because once in our life, we experienced something close to what the actor is living on the screen, even if our version was less dramatic, less violent. Very rarely do the stakes in our lives rise so high, nor do the contours of a movie mimic the passage of time that defines our existence \u2014 but the intensity of feeling can\u2019t be diminished when we relate to someone else\u2019s experience, when we see what we know being reenacted, and understand it to be true. After the release this past summer of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d a romantic comedy about a young woman who discovers her boyfriend\u2019s enormous wealth (and one of only three major Hollywood films ever to have a majority Asian cast), I\u2019ve fantasized about recasting various classic American films with faces that look like mine. What if \u201cFerris Bueller\u201d took place in Pasadena and not Chicago, if its projection of youthful freedom and dilettantish attention span \u2014 youth is now, and now is free \u2014 were something you could see played out among a well-to-do Chinese family? Or if \u201cThe Graduate\u201d was about Mrs. Kwan, not Mrs. Robinson, a complex woman with whom we could understand the isolation of an empty marriage? Or if \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d was about a young Japanese-American woman in the suburbs of San Francisco just discovering the power of her sexuality? These coming-of-age films \u2014 however limited or dated they may seem today \u2014 did one specific thing for me when I first watched them: They allowed me to witness the complexity of an individual\u2019s interiority. I saw characters who desired something or someone in life they didn\u2019t have, I saw them stumble and learn from their mistakes and I saw them grow from them. It\u2019s a redemptive, satisfying feeling. All stereotypes reduce. Asian-American actors have largely been either fulfillments or denials of clich\u00e9s. If we are never granted the right to a personality, if we are only perceived as heartless automatons just one point away from a perfect SAT score \u2014 then we are certainly never going to be granted the opportunity to live full lives on the screen. Robots, after all, are born fully formed. Perhaps, other Asian-Americans have argued, we aren\u2019t vocal enough. We don\u2019t get worked up, we don\u2019t cause a fuss. Our parents don\u2019t encourage us to take risks, to rebel. We are too polite, too cautious. But I don\u2019t buy it. I think that you refuse to see us. To look at us for who we are. As with so many other minorities in America, you are comfortable enjoying the work we make. But representation is about demanding more: more leading Asian-American actors, more films in which we are allowed the everyday banalities of our existence. The anxieties, the boredom, the simple gestures of affection. It\u2019s about showing that you are like us. Not the other way around. Not adjacent. Not other. IN ALL ART, the specific is the universal. Today, society can see itself in films that star black people, gay people, older women and transgender people, because even though those stories are about experiences specific to them, they are also stories about being human. There is no perfect outcome in the battle of representation, at least not today, but their presence on screens is a bestowment of dignity, because it demands that society look at them \u2014 not past or through them. In the critic Wesley Yang\u2019s 2011 essay \u201cPaper Tigers,\u201d about the stereotypes surrounding Asian-American overachievers, he consistently returns to the face, his own or that of his subjects: \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll glimpse my reflection in a window and feel astonished by what I see. Jet-black hair. Slanted eyes. A pancake-flat surface of yellow-and-green-toned skin. An expression that is nearly reptilian in its impassivity.\u201d He speaks with a young man named Jefferson Mao, who aspires to be a writer but recalls his experience at Manhattan\u2019s Stuyvesant High School as being part \u201cof a mob of \u2018nameless, faceless Asian kids who were like a part of the d\u00e9cor of the place.\u2019 \u201d Yang continues: \u201cHere is what I sometimes suspect my face signifies to other Americans: an invisible person, barely distinguishable from a mass of faces that resemble it. A conspicuous person standing apart from the crowd and yet devoid of any individuality. An icon of so much that the culture pretends to honor but that it in fact patronizes and exploits.\u201d When I was 10 years old, I stole a blond wig from the theater camp I attended that summer. I wore it alone in my room. I paraded in front of my mirror with it perched on my head like the feathers of a cockatoo. When it was on, I let myself fantasize about being a white girl. It was then that the more Chinese side of me became visible. The beige and yellow undertones of my skin clashed with the golden yellow of the wig. The almond shape of my brown eyes didn\u2019t sit as well as the pretty blue eyes I imagined having beneath the flaxen bangs. I was trying to erase a side of myself. But in doing so, I only saw myself more clearly.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/t-magazine/asian-american-actors-representation.html", "date": "2018-11-06 00:00:00", "author": "By Thessaly La Force", "description": "Actors of Asian descent have long either been cast as stereotypes \u2014 in embarrassing, demeaning roles \u2014 or simply whitewashed out of the picture.", "title": "Why Do Asian-Americans Remain Largely Unseen in Film and Television?"},
{"content": "When I was 15, I met a dancer from Canada\u2019s Royal Winnipeg Ballet. The company had come to Los Angeles to dance in the Olympic Arts Festival, and my parents volunteered to host a post-performance dinner in our backyard. I recall about 200 people \u2014 family friends, Olympic officials and maybe 25 dancers \u2014 eating curry (is that right?) off paper plates. But that\u2019s not what this is about. No, this is about the ballerino \u2014 my word for him \u2014 I met and what he represented to a lonely gay kid in Southern California in 1984, a kid who had never before met another gay person. Earlier that evening, I had seen the dancer turn, leap and smile onstage, expressing through the mute language of ballet who he was. Something about his movement told me he was gay, and I felt he was dancing not only for himself but for me. Onstage, the ballerino wore brown tights that showed the trunks of his thighs, and everything else. Now he was in loose linen pants with a drawstring belt and an open collar that exposed the rod of his clavicle. He said hello. I could barely speak. He might have said, \u201cLovely party,\u201d but that was it, he was on his way. The isolation of my queer youth was about to return. Out of nowhere, I told him he was my favorite ballet dancer in the world. He seemed startled, and a little embarrassed, but he came to understand what I was trying to say: \u201cIf you need someone to talk to, you can write me, care of the Ballet.\u201d The next day, I rode my bike to the library and looked up the address in Winnipeg and sent a letter trying to express something about myself I had never expressed before. Two months later, he wrote back, apologizing: He\u2019d been on tour. Although time has devoured that sheet of paper, I still remember the gentle message embedded in his words: One day, you too will find yourself. On a muggy afternoon in Harlem, Preston Chamblee, 23, a member of New York City Ballet since 2015, says to me, \u201cI hope to be part of a generation that can change the boundaries of what ballet can do, a generation that says we\u2019re going to represent everyone, not just the stories that have been told before.\u201d We\u2019re looking at a Facebook video of Chamblee and his fellow company member Taylor Stanley, 27, in a romantic pas de deux in the choreographer Lauren Lovette\u2019s \u201cNot Our Fate.\u201d The ballet depicts a love story between two men of color not as subtext but as central narrative. When it premiered last fall at New York\u2019s David H. Koch Theater, it sent a jolt of relevance through an art form that often feels mired in another era. It\u2019s a thrilling duet, both men in white T-shirts and black pants moving toward and away from each other, embracing and rejecting and succumbing to desire and love. Rather than putting a man into a woman\u2019s role, Lovette choreographed the piece for two men; the audience can see the dancers negotiating their positions, just as queer couples negotiate theirs. (I showed the clip to a gay friend, who said, \u201cThat basically sums up my relationship with my boyfriend.\u201d) Men have danced together before in ballet, typically in expressions of friendship or rivalry, such as the death duet between Tybalt and Mercutio in \u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d first choreographed in Czechoslovakia by Ivo Vana Psota in 1938. We\u2019ve seen choreographers invert genders, often casting men as Cinderella\u2019s evil stepsisters for a laugh. Yet Chamblee had never performed a pas de deux explicitly depicting two men in love. Shortly after \u201cNot Our Fate\u201d premiered, Justin Peck, City Ballet\u2019s resident choreographer, further challenged ballet\u2019s gender norms when he adapted the woman\u2019s role in the pas de deux at the heart of his 2017 \u201cThe Times Are Racing,\u201d pairing Stanley with Daniel Applebaum, a 32-year-old gay soloist with the company. If you didn\u2019t know much about classical ballet, you might think it\u2019s an obvious home for queer artists and narratives, but it\u2019s more complicated than that: Ballet, of course, has always had gay dancers and choreographers and homoeroticism, but it\u2019s an artistic discipline shaped by tradition. The canon is small; the institutions are formal and steeped in history; and the masters who cast the principal male roles \u2014 Romeo, Don Quixote, Prince Siegfried in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d \u2014 sometimes select dancers who embody the conventional male hero, onstage and off. To have a public queer identity, or to be perceived as too effeminate, can still affect a dancer\u2019s ability to land these lead roles. It\u2019s one of ballet\u2019s ironies \u2014 the outside world has long viewed the male dancer as the antithesis of conventional masculinity, yet the culture inside ballet can still be somewhat bro-y. (A recent lawsuit by a female dancer against City Ballet, three of its former male principals and a financial donor, who were accused of sharing sexually explicit images of female dancers, cites the company\u2019s \u201cfraternity-like atmosphere,\u201d which City Ballet denies.) This is one reason \u201cNot Our Fate\u201d means so much to Chamblee. For the first time, he says, \u201cI really got to be absolutely nobody but myself onstage.\u201d Chamblee is part of a new generation of dancers who are collapsing the boundaries between queerness and maleness in ballet by challenging its, and the culture\u2019s, preconceived ideas of masculinity. They use social media, especially Instagram, to express themselves creatively and corporeally, building an audience much larger than what a company alone can bring them. Their work onstage and online rejects the idea that a male dancer must store his queerness in his locker. They see no contradiction in the serious artist who dances on ballet\u2019s largest stages and also posts videos of himself, say, dancing on a treadmill in platform heels. In doing so, these dancers are taking some of the starch out of ballet. Last June, London\u2019s Royal Ballet hung the rainbow flag outside its historic home for the first time. For Marcelino Samb\u00e9, 24, a soloist at the company, \u201cit tells everyone it\u2019s an open institution. Come on in.\u201d There\u2019s a hashtag for everything on Instagram; when you type #gayballet, you will come across men in tights and training shorts, and eventually you might find James Whiteside, most likely bare-chested with a large scratch tattooed on his ribs. Whiteside, 34, is a principal dancer with New York\u2019s American Ballet Theater and, since joining the company in 2012, one of its major stars; critics applaud his power and energy and the depth he brings to his characters. For the choreographer Lar Lubovitch\u2019s 2015 production of \u201cOthello,\u201d Whiteside didn\u2019t want to waste the opportunity of working with a gay collaborator \u2014 his Iago was infused with what he calls \u201cqueer rage.\u201d This month, at New York\u2019s Joyce Theater, Whiteside opened the celebrated choreographer Arthur Pita\u2019s new ballet, \u201cThe Tenant,\u201d based on Roland Topor\u2019s 1964 French novel and Roman Polanski\u2019s film adaptation of the same name, which questions ideas of identity and gender. \u201cMy personality was maybe something that ABT hadn\u2019t encountered before,\u201d Whiteside says. \u201cI would come in \u2018yaass kween\u2019-ing everyone and doing drag queen walks, and that could have been so easily misconstrued as not taking the work seriously.\u201d But Whiteside takes his work very seriously because he doesn\u2019t want to, as he puts it, go back. Back to his late teens in South Boston when people regularly threw rocks at him and called him the F-word on his way to and from Boston Ballet. \u201cI found myself a target anywhere I went,\u201d he says. Like anyone who\u2019s danced through fire and come out burnished, Whiteside can now laugh at his past and turn it into a personal statement and meta joke on Instagram. In one post, he\u2019s flexing his biceps while wearing a pink bandanna, a black tutu and a tank top that says \u201cMilk\u2019s Gym\u201d (Milk is the drag name of his boyfriend, Daniel Donigan, who appeared on two seasons of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d). Whiteside\u2019s caption: \u201cMasc femme butch kween horse peasant monarch wealthy broke realness.\u201d Then a shrugging-guy emoji. What he hears most from his 171,000 Instagram followers is that he looks like he\u2019s having fun. And he is. Dancing with ABT has been his dream since he was a boy, when he attended a gala and visited the principals\u2019 red-velvet hallway backstage. He loves ballet and wants others to fall in love with it, too, and he hopes his feed will bring more people into the theater. But it bugs him that so much of ballet Instagram \u2014 his own at times, too \u2014 is \u201cdancer thirst trap.\u201d The twerking and the tights and the belts are a misleading representation of the work, the almost inhuman physical effort behind a dancer doing splits in the air. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to understand what we really do from Instagram, where everything has a smile on it and a cigarette in its mouth,\u201d he says. \u201cBallet is one of the most physically demanding things in the world, but you have to seem like you\u2019re just taking a whiz.\u201d Whiteside has a point. But like any protagonist, he can\u2019t see himself as we do. Before social media, ballet on video \u2014 think of those tame PBS broadcasts \u2014 appealed to a specialized audience. One reason is its perspective: The cameras, way up in the auditorium, show ballet from a limited point of view. But on Instagram, the close-up angles, taped ankles, the veins and arteries flooded with blood, give us ballet as the dancer experiences it. Rather than removing the magic of a darkened theater, this intimacy brings us closer to the my-God-how-does-the-human-body-do-that awe that ballet inspires. In one post, we see Whiteside\u2019s backside, naked but for the straps of a well-worn dance belt. But this isn\u2019t just a thirst trap. It\u2019s a hard, strangely shaped, almost gnarled piece of flesh. The caption \u2014 \u201cDancer butt\u201d \u2014 tells us we\u2019re looking at decades of sacrifice knotted up in muscle and skin. It shows us the feat behind the art, reminding us that the foundation of dance is physical strength \u2014 a quality associated with traditional masculinity. Whiteside is an athlete-artist restless with ideas and energy, and Instagram gives him a space arguably bigger than a company\u2019s stage to experiment with what it now means to be a great dancer. Harper Watters, 26, is many things: acclaimed Houston Ballet soloist; son of two former college professors; host of a backstage chat show called \u201cThe Pre Show\u201d on his YouTube channel; a black gay man from New Hampshire now living in Texas; a lean, inventive artist who dances with the freedom that comes from knowing who you are; a devourer of pop culture. On his website, he calls himself the Wendy Williams of ballet. When I talk to him, he elaborates: \u201cIf Wendy Williams and Beyonc\u00e9 had a love child who they put in ballet, it would 100 percent be me.\u201d In one episode of \u201cThe Pre Show,\u201d filmed behind the scenes of a performance of \u201cSwan Lake\u201d in Minneapolis, he and his fellow dancer Hayden Stark sit at the mirror applying their characters\u2019 makeup while talking about college, sex, queer persecution in Russia and facial hair. In many ways, this could be a live-stream of two young gay men getting ready for a night out at the bars, but over the course of the 16.5-minute segment, the dancers transform into their ballet roles. Dressed as a swan hunter, Watters talks to the camera in a butch tone and says he and Stark are about to go out and do \u201cboy things\u201d like seducing women and fighting, but then they laugh and return to their natural voices \u2014 distinctly, unapologetically gay \u2014 and clarify, \u201ca different kind of boy thing.\u201d If ballet feels remote to many, especially younger people, this type of access and authenticity connects the medium to today\u2019s cultural currents. Watters says he\u2019s influenced as much by classical ballet as by reality television, including \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d and \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u201d He\u2019s faced some backlash online about how he \u201crepresents\u201d the Houston Ballet, which he joined as an apprentice in 2011, but that criticism seems out of step with what the word \u201crepresentation\u201d now means in our culture. \u201cThe Pre Show\u201d is ostensibly about a dancer preparing for his roles, but its subtext is stereotypes \u2014 an artist owning, defying and subverting them as part of the process of becoming himself. Two years ago, before his promotion to demisoloist, a director taught Watters an important lesson: Ballet isn\u2019t really about how high your legs can go or how many turns you can do, but what you\u2019re trying to say about yourself and the world. Every step has to have intention. As a ballet student in Sweden, the dancer Pontus Lidberg, 41, had a hypermasculine, almost cartoonish notion of what a ballerino should be \u2014 the guy who pulls up to the theater on a motorcycle, muscles his way through \u201cQuixote\u201d and caps off the evening with a ballerina. This was the dominant narrative in the 1990s, when only a few male dancers were openly gay. He sees it as part of the aftermath of the AIDS epidemic that killed so many artists, including, in 1993, ballet\u2019s global celebrity, Rudolf Nureyev, who cracked the door to his closet but never fully emerged from it. \u201cI had no role models,\u201d Lidberg says. \u201cI had to create that myself.\u201d Lidberg has since become a leading choreographer around the world, developing works for companies such as City Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet. In his latest piece, \u201cSiren,\u201d performed in October at the Joyce, he flips the genders in Homer\u2019s \u201cOdyssey.\u201d Ulysses is a woman, and the sirens \u2014 the original temptations \u2014 are men. Its central theme is that existential desire to connect. Like the dancers he mentors, Lidberg is part of a cohort of choreographers (some of whom are straight) expanding ballet by telling new stories, which includes Peck, Lovette and Joshua Beamish, whose 2015 piece \u201cBurrow\u201d depicts the arc of a relationship between two men, set to the music of the 20th-century Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Last year, the Russian choreographer Yuri Possokhov\u2019s ballet for Moscow\u2019s Bolshoi Theater, based on the life of Nureyev, was postponed two days before its world premiere. The authorities arrested its director on suspicion of embezzling government funds, although many suspect the ballet\u2019s frankness about its subject\u2019s sexuality might have been the real issue. \u201cNureyev\u201d opened five months later. (Possokhov declined to comment for this story.) Watching ballet is ultimately ephemeral \u2014 \u201can experience that can never be relived,\u201d Lidberg says. So, too, is the body, especially the dancer\u2019s. \u201cAging is very real, and for the dancer, it happens very quickly.\u201d Rather than lamenting this, he embraces it, filming his work and releasing it on social media. In his 2007 ballet film, \u201cThe Rain,\u201d he dances a pas de deux with a close male friend in a downpour to Doris Day\u2019s \u201cPerhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps\u201d (1965). \u201cMy identity as a gay man has many layers,\u201d Lidberg adds. He also tries to convey something he rarely sees in ballet \u2014 not just sexuality, but companionship and tenderness between men. In other words, love. \u201cI am a ballerina,\u201d says Chase Johnsey. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve done my whole career.\u201d Johnsey, 33, danced principal female roles en pointe for more than a decade with Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, the all-male ballet comedy, but he left the company at the end of last year, after he began to identify as gender fluid. Johnsey, who uses male pronouns, says he and others felt harassed because \u201cwe don\u2019t live up to some masculine ideal of what a gay man is.\u201d (Trockadero says Johnsey\u2019s claims were investigated and no evidence to support them was found.) Growing up in what he calls \u201cthe swamps of Florida,\u201d Johnsey remembers watching the ballerinas in class and wanting nothing more than to dance like them. An essential part of queerness is fluidity \u2014 between identities, expectations, definitions and that word no one likes, labels. And what is dance if not fluid \u2014 in motion, in music, in the blend between physical and artistic? Ballet is most powerful when it is most fluid. So, too, is the dancer, when he, or she, or they, moves fluidly. A dancer must move between roles \u2014 now Romeo, now a prince, now a ruby \u2014 just as a queer person moves between roles, finding comfort and creativity in that movement. But classical ballet isn\u2019t fluid. It\u2019s rigid with custom and stiff with history. \u201cYou have all these people who love the way it\u2019s been for 200 years,\u201d Johnsey says. Johnsey made history this past June by dancing in the female corps in \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty\u201d with English National Ballet. His dream now: to play the lead, Odette, in a major company\u2019s production of \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d not as female but as gender fluid, which he defines as identifying as male in some contexts and female in others. He sees the artistic potential of bringing this to a character who transforms from swan to human and back. \u201cIf art reflects the state of the world, then I\u2019m in the right place at the right time,\u201d he says. It would seem that way: Lukas Dhont\u2019s movie \u201cGirl,\u201d about a 15-year-old transgender ballerina, is Belgium\u2019s much-lauded entry for the upcoming Academy Awards. And a revival of Matthew Bourne\u2019s now-legendary 1995 \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d which features all-male swans, will open next month in London. But since the final curtain at the London Coliseum, Johnsey\u2019s phone hasn\u2019t rung. He now mentors young transgender and gender-nonconforming dancers. \u201cI\u2019ll probably never dance leading roles again,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t care because there are so many kids out there who contact me on Instagram who think they don\u2019t have a fighting chance. I can give them that.\u201d Every dancer I spoke with has a story of how their art touched someone in unexpected ways, just as the ballerino from Winnipeg gave me something I could carry far into my future. Art is nothing if it does not connect, and these dancers are connecting with people who might previously have thought ballet could not, or would not, speak for them. Whiteside tells me about a letter he received from a woman who thinks her young son is gay. The boy loves to dance, the mother writes, and wants to be like Whiteside when he grows up. His classmates make fun of him for loving ballet, but the mother is proud of her son for staying resolute; seeing Whiteside become successful gives her hope as a parent. \u201cI wrote her back and said that was me \u2014 headstrong little effeminate gay kid,\u201d Whiteside says. He keeps the letter in his locker with his tights and his shoes, and when he thinks of it, he marvels: \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re doing, and then someone\u2019s a little more O.K. because of what you did.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/t-magazine/gay-male-ballet-dancers.html", "date": "2018-11-05 00:00:00", "author": "By David Ebershoff", "description": "These men are finding new stages on which to express their queerness, collapsing gender barriers in the world of dance.", "title": "How a Group of Gay Male Ballet Dancers Is Rethinking Masculinity"},

Not everyone starts there, but I look at it the same way I look at the opening of a book. If the first few paragraphs engage me, I\u2019m much more likely to continue reading. This is especially important with themeless puzzles, in my opinion. If you put a ubiquitous word like THE at 1A, there had better be something else that really stands out in that corner, or there\u2019s a bit of a letdown.  That\u2019s why I love Robyn Weintraub\u2019s puzzles. Ms. Weintraub knows how to make an entrance, so to speak. When we last saw her, she opened with AND WE\u2019RE OFF, and today, she has loaded the lot of us into a series of CLOWN CARS. Right below that are a set of TREE HOUSES, as well as the lovely and little seen word RETROGRADE. I don\u2019t know about you, but now I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what else she has in store in her grid. And the rest doesn\u2019t disappoint. In the opposite corner, we have WAIT LISTED, INSOMNIACS and TEENAGERS (is that a minitheme we have here?). You can get lost in a TOURIST TRAP and eat some FUNNEL CAKES or CANDY CANEs. And we can hold hands and smash the GLASS CEILING (a debut) together. What even more impressive to me is how clean the grid is. Even with an entry that might seem gluey on the surface, like SEANS at 28A, the clue is so interesting from a historical point of view \u2014 SEAN\u2019S Bar is the oldest pub in Ireland, dating back to A.D. 900 \u2014 that I\u2019m willing to give it a pass.  1A: I\u2019ll bet your brain didn\u2019t automatically go to CLOWN CARS for \u201cHigh occupancy vehicles?\u201d 14A: And I\u2019ll bet your brain, like mine, didn\u2019t automatically leap to TREE HOUSES for \u201cSome high-rise constructions. 27A: The answer to \u201cTouchy sort?\u201d is MIDAS, as in the tale about the king who wished that everything he touched would turn to gold.  41A: Ifyay ouyay on\u2019tday ecognizeray atwhay AMSCRAY isyay, ou\u2019veyay obviouslyyay evernay earnedlay igpay atinlay, ayay ademay upyay anguagelay. 54A: With the question mark, think about tongues outside the mouth.

{"content": "To watch \u201cWeightless\u201d is to worry for 93 minutes. Here, deeply damaged people are prone to exasperating decisions. Yet these characters are so strikingly realized that you can\u2019t help but care for them. It\u2019s a potent mixture of feelings, to be frustrated by someone\u2019s actions and, at the same time, hope that he stays safe. While working at a landfill in rural New York, Joel (Alessandro Nivola) receives a phone call saying that Will (Eli Haley), his 10-year-old son who he has never seen, has been abandoned by Joel\u2019s former wife. Joel, who is struggling with mental illness, takes in Will, who has health problems of his own. Soon there are serious questions about Joel\u2019s competence and Will\u2019s well-being. No one here, including Julianne Nicholson as Joel\u2019s girlfriend, Janeece, speaks when a gesture or expression would serve better. Several long, wordless stretches arise during the film, all of them thoughtful. Jaron Albertin, directing his first feature, cultivates tension in small moments and doesn\u2019t force the drama. The script, by Albertin and the playwright Enda Walsh (whose screenplay for \u201cHunger,\u201d with Steve McQueen, featured similar meaningful silences), captures the rough poetry of working-class days and nights. Nivola\u2019s taciturn performance is mesmeric, while Haley delivers an affecting film debut. Both deftly embody lives that are often overlooked. A somewhat stronger plot may have made \u201cWeightless\u201d more taut, and perhaps more commercial. But the search for honest emotions, rather than a quest for constant action, takes precedence in nearly every scene.

{"content": "A former United States representative from Texas was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay about $1 million in restitution after being convicted of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars meant for charity and using it to pay for personal expenses and his political campaigns. In April, a federal jury found the former congressman, Steve Stockman, 61, guilty on 23 counts \u2014 including money laundering, conspiracy and making false statements \u2014 after prosecutors alleged that he had orchestrated a yearslong scheme to defraud charitable donors. Two of Mr. Stockman\u2019s former aides also pleaded guilty last year to multiple counts connected to the case. \u201cAt trial, the government proved to the jury that former Congressman Stockman ran his campaign and fraudulent charities to simply enrich himself and defrauded well-meaning donors,\u201d Ryan K. Patrick, United States attorney for the Southern District of Texas, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThis type of corruption by public officials gives our entire democratic system a black eye.\u201d Marlo P. Cadeddu, a lawyer for Mr. Stockman, said in an interview on Wednesday that the government had asked for a 210-month sentence, \u201cso this is better than it could have been\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re gratified by that.\u201d She added that in the coming weeks, her team plans to appeal Mr. Stockman\u2019s conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Mr. Stockman, a Republican, served one term in the mid-1990s and another from 2013 to 2015. He also ran unsuccessfully for United States Senate in 2014. Throughout his latter days in politics, Mr. Stockman stood out for being intensely anti-Obama. In 2014, Mr. Stockman walked out of Mr. Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in protest. He also sold Obama \u201cbarf bags\u201d as a campaign fund-raiser. At trial, prosecutors alleged that from May 2010 to February 2014, Mr. Stockman and his aides solicited about $1.25 million in charitable donations \u201cbased on false pretenses, then used a series of sham nonprofit organizations and dozens of bank accounts to launder the money,\u201d a Justice Department statement said. Specifically, prosecutors alleged that in 2010, Mr. Stockman and one of his aides solicited an elderly donor for $285,000, which the pair said would be used for legitimate charitable and educational purposes. Instead, they used a sham charity to funnel the money such that it could be used for a variety of personal expenses. In the years that followed, prosecutors said Mr. Stockman and the aide received an additional $165,000 in charitable donations from the donor, much of which Mr. Stockman used illegally to finance his 2012 congressional campaign. Such behavior continued after Mr. Stockman took office in 2013, according the Justice Department. He and the aide used the name of another sham nonprofit entity \u2014 \u201cLife Without Limits\u201d \u2014 to solicit a $350,000 charitable donation, which he said would be used to create an educational center called the Freedom House. Instead the money went to a variety of personal and campaign expenses, prosecutors said. Prosecutors also showed at trial that Mr. Stockman did not pay taxes on the fraudulently acquired donations. At one point, Mr. Stockman even directed one of his aides to flee to Cairo so that the aide could not be questioned by law enforcement agencies, the Justice Department said. Recounting Wednesday\u2019s sentencing from inside the courtroom, Courthouse News Service reported that Judge Lee Rosenthal of United States District Court admonished Mr. Stockman, saying he had shown a willingness to exploit others and ruin their lives. And after handing down Mr. Stockman\u2019s 120-month sentence, she reportedly quipped: \u201cThat\u2019s a long time, but Mr. Stockman, I think you earned it.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/steve-stockman-texas.html", "date": "2018-11-07 00:00:00", "author": "By Matt Stevens", "description": "The former representative from Texas was also ordered to pay about $1 million in restitution.

{"content": "LONDON \u2014 If generosity of spirit were everything, \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d would be a triumph. Zadie Smith\u2019s 2000 novel remains one of the most notable debut works of fiction in recent times, and the stage adaptation at the Kiln Theater in London marches to the same compassionate drum as the book. (The production, which opened Tuesday, runs through Dec. 22.) London\u2019s is a theater culture that likes dramatized novels (let\u2019s not forget a little show called \u201cLes Miserables\u201d), but Stephen Sharkey\u2019s version of Ms. Smith\u2019s capacious narrative frustrates as often as it enchants. You sense the spirit of multicultural celebration intended by Mr. Sharkey and the show\u2019s director, Indhu Rubasingham, who is also the artistic director of the Kiln. We live in divided times, to which Ms. Smith\u2019s portrait of a teeming, ceaselessly inclusive London can be seen as a corrective. Yet not for the first time, a book full of incident and character suffers in the filleting necessary to bring it to the theater. Film may be a more sensible outlet for Ms. Smith\u2019s vision of a London populated largely by outsiders who have managed miraculously to coalesce. In fact, a four-part TV version aired here in 2002. Seen amid the broader London theatrical landscape, \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d furthers an interest in and insistence on racial diversity that extends to the Young Vic\u2019s current production of \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d which relocates Shakespeare\u2019s comedy to the bubbling cultural melting pot that is the Notting Hill district of London in the annual run-up to its late-summer Carnival. Both shows give a picture of racial harmony that isn\u2019t always evident in other plays currently on view here. The new (and dispiriting) Martin McDonagh play, \u201cA Very Very Very Dark Matter,\u201d spins a yarn of appropriation and even enslavement, in which the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen has an unexpected ghost writer: a one-legged Congolese \u201cpygmy\u201d (the American newcomer Johnetta Eula\u2019Mae Ackles) whom he keeps in a cage in his attic. Arinz\u00e9 Kene\u2019s punchy \u201cMisty,\u201d at Trafalgar Studios, confronts head-on the difficulty of being a black artist in a white world. It will be followed at the Trafalgar by the commercial transfer of Natasha Gordon\u2019s National Theater hit, \u201cNine Night,\u201d whose portrait of cultural commingling better echoes the spirit of \u201cWhite Teeth.\u201d It\u2019s difficult, however, to imagine \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d having much of a future life, at least not without serious reconsideration. While you can understand the creators\u2019 shared desire to exult in the vocal polyphony that exists just beyond the Kiln\u2019s front door (Ms. Smith\u2019s novel is set in a nearby corner of the city), the result seems inchoate and piecemeal, and the inclusion of songs (13 in all, most of them undistinguished) does nothing but present a hurdle to further development of the script. The focus of the novel has been altered, as has its sweep \u2014 inevitably, given that the book runs to 500-plus pages in paperback. Instead of starting with the suicidal, several-times-married Englishman Archie Jones (here played by a sad-eyed Richard Lumsden), the play kicks off with a knowing wink to the audience from our shrill-voiced guide for the evening: Mad Mary (Michele Austin), a lesser character in the novel whom Ms. Smith describes as a \u201cblack voodoo woman\u201d and who is onstage to lead us through the familial truth-telling that drives the play. In an impulsive gesture, Mary jabs her dentist, Rosie Jones (Amanda Wilkin), with a syringe, which in turn leads to a clunkily managed tumble backward through time. \u201cWait! Where are we now? What year?\u201d Rosie asks at the start of the second act, to which one can only reply that if the characters can\u2019t follow their own story, how are we supposed to? Devotees of the novel will note the importance given to Rosie, a new character; it\u2019s her mother, Irie (Ayesha Antoine), who figures heavily in the book. Rosie\u2019s father could be one or the other of a pair of Anglo-Bengali twins \u2014 the bookish, fully Anglicized Millat Iqbal (Assad Zaman) or his radicalized brother, Magid (a notably intense Sid Sagar). And so we have a panorama that folds various ethnicities, religions and nationalities into a story here told in reverse, allowing Rosie to wake up to a fuller sense of herself by the time the play reaches what is clearly intended to be a life-enhancing finish. It falls to the twins\u2019 father, Samad (Tony Jayawardena), a Bangladeshi long based in London, to voice the thesis of the play when he attests to the ability of his adopted city to get under the skin of its inhabitants. Mad Mary expands on that sense of connection near the end when she name checks the neighborhood of the Kiln itself and speaks of \u201ckissing the Kilburn air\u201d \u2014 a lovely sentiment that spreads good cheer, even if the play itself lacks the breath of life. There\u2019s scant reason to applaud the landscape that gets laid bare in \u201cEar for Eye,\u201d the latest Royal Court entry from the black British writer-director Debbie Tucker Green, who prefers a lowercase rendering of her name and the play\u2019s title. (Her biting production runs through Nov. 24.) A triptych lasting more than two hours with no intermission, the play casts an unsparingly bleak, clinical eye on race relations in Britain and the United States, and concludes with two brief films connecting the grievous state of affairs now with America\u2019s Jim Crow legislation of old and the slave laws under which Jamaicans suffered during British rule. Each third of the play has its own style and strategy: The middle section in effect rewrites David Mamet\u2019s eternally contentious teacher/student smackdown, \u201cOleanna,\u201d to apply here to an African-American female student (Lashana Lynch) and a white male professor who can\u2019t regard the younger woman as anything but \u201ca problem.\u201d Demetri Goritsas in the role is the only white actor in the accomplished, entirely committed cast. Possessed of a jagged rhythm in her writing that echoes Mr. Mamet\u2019s, Ms. Green ends her play with the repetition of a sentence \u2014 \u201cGive me one reason to not\u201d \u2014 that remains purposefully unfinished.

Dickinson plays Jim, a working-class lad who moves to London and quickly falls in with a group of male escorts who cater to a very specific sort of patron. Calling themselves the Raconteurs, these young men know \u201cyour Goya from your Gogol, your Fritz Lang from your Fassbinder,\u201d and specialize in sparkling postcoital conversation and intellectual debate with refined, wealthy, older male clients.

It\u2019s a real psychological condition known as \u201cStendhal Syndrome,\u201d whereby individuals experience rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and even unconsciousness after witnessing overwhelming beauty. Here, however, it\u2019s treated more as a clever device to propel Jim into the paintings themselves, as he hallucinates himself and his friends posing for great artists. As one might guess, McLean is not looking to offer a realistic depiction of life as a prostitute. Rather, he seems interested in exploring how beauty has been used and exploited over the centuries. The film\u2019s elegant compositions themselves are painterly, with the actors carefully posed; and the atmosphere is theatrical, with crisp line readings and sparsely populated frames.

Or, for some, perhaps it would be more fitting to say: Good morning, it\u2019s Election Day?! In any case, here are answers to some commonly asked questions about voting. There are a few websites you can visit to check your voter registration and find your polling place. VoteSaveAmerica asks you to enter basic personal information to determine whether you\u2019re registered. That tool is supported by Vote.org, a nonpartisan nonprofit seeking to increase voter turnout. Another website that lets people quickly check their voter registration status is run by HeadCount, a nonpartisan group; you can use it to verify that you are registered and the location of your polling place. Whether voters must show valid identification at their polling place varies by state. As of August, 35 states have some type of voter ID law, according to VoteRiders, a nonpartisan organization that helps demystify state voter ID laws. [Here\u2019s what voter intimidation looks like and what you can do about it] VoteRiders publishes a map that breaks down voter ID laws by state, so you can use it to determine what your state requires. The strictest voter ID laws can be found in states like North Dakota and Georgia, said Kathleen Unger, the founder of VoteRiders. Those states require residents to bring specific types of identification to their polling place. [Read more about how, when and where to vote here.] States like New York or California generally do not require voters to provide IDs after residents have registered, Ms. Unger said. First-time voters in those states should bring identification, however. If you need further help, you can contact VoteRiders by phone or email \u2014 it will help you figure out the intricacies of your state\u2019s laws. Although you might want to show support for your chosen candidate through your outfit, that might not be legal in your state. This year the Supreme Court struck down a Minnesota law that prohibited voters from wearing T-shirts, hats and buttons expressing political views at polling places. Minnesota\u2019s law was particularly broad, however, and it was enforced to ban even general political messaging on issues like gun rights or labor unions. State laws that ban apparel supporting or opposing specific candidates or ballot measures are acceptable, according to the court\u2019s majority opinion. Jeanette Senecal, with the League of Women Voters, suggests that, to be on the safe side, voters leave their partisan apparel at home. But if you end up wearing it anyway, election supervisors will often ask you to turn your shirt inside-out in the bathroom, Ms. Senecal said. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] Every time you change your address permanently, you\u2019re supposed to re-register or change your voter registration information. You should check your state\u2019s laws to determine what sort of documentation, like a driver\u2019s license or utility bill, you may need to bring to the polling place for proof of your new address. In some states, like Pennsylvania, if you change your address within 30 days before an election you can vote at the polling place associated with your old address. In Wisconsin, you\u2019re eligible to vote with your old address if you\u2019ve lived for fewer than 10 consecutive days at your new address. Details vary, so check your state\u2019s official rules. Don\u2019t leave just yet. If you are turned away because you\u2019re told you do not have the right form of identification, ask to speak with the polling supervisor to determine whether you are getting the right information, or call the VoteRiders hotline to get the advice of an expert, Ms. Unger said. [Read more about what to do if you are turned away from the polls.] Another hotline to call is 866-687-8683, which is run by Election Protection, a nonpartisan organization. If your identification or voter registration is still challenged, Ms. Senecal said, you should ask for a provisional ballot, which means your vote is contingent on verification of your eligibility. If your qualifications can be verified later, your vote will be counted.

{"content": "TORONTO \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stood in Parliament on Wednesday and apologized for Canada\u2019s decision to turn away a steamliner full of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany on the eve of the Holocaust 79 years ago, saying it reflected years of regrettable anti-Semitic foreign policy. The Canadian government at the time, run by the same Liberal party that Mr. Trudeau leads today, refused to allow the steamliner, the St. Louis, to land in June 1939 after it had been blocked from docking at its original destination, Havana. The boat was filled with more than 900 passengers, most of them Jews who had fled Germany four months before World War II began. \u201cWe apologize to the mothers and fathers whose children we did not save, to the daughters and sons whose parents we did not help,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. The United States also refused the captain\u2019s desperate pleas for asylum, as did Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Panama. In the end, the boat returned to Europe, but not to Germany. Jewish organizations secured them visas to Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. But, as Germany expanded its territory, some 254 were captured and killed in Nazi death camps. \u201cWe refused to help them when we could have. We contributed to sealing the cruel fates of far too many at places like Auschwitz, Treblinka and Belzec. We failed them. And for that, we are sorry,\u201d said Mr. Trudeau, wearing a red poppy on the lapel of his suit as is Canadian tradition in November to mark Remembrance Day. Since he was elected three years ago, Mr. Trudeau has made apologizing a regular ritual, even by Canadian standards. The apologies, in large part, are a reflection of the country\u2019s continued struggle to atone for its colonial and racist past, particularly when it comes to its treatment of First Nations people. While some have begun to roll their eyes, other Canadians say they are proud the country is making amends. [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] Canadians today tend to think of their country as compassionate and tolerant. But its position on Jewish refugees before, during and after the war was infamously articulated by one government official at the time: None is too many. Britain accepted 70,000 Jewish refugees between the rise of Hitler in Germany in 1933 and the end of the war in 1945. The United States took in 200,000. Vast and underpopulated Canada accepted 5,000. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s apology came less than two weeks after a gunman opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers, and at a time when anti-Semitism is rising across North America. It was not lost on many that it was delivered the day after an American election campaign marked by refugee-bashing. \u201cThe rhetoric we are hearing across the border is very similar to the rhetoric we heard in the 1930s \u2014 the vilification of the other, the vilification of the press. It\u2019s really scary,\u201d said Danny Gruner, who attended Wednesday\u2019s apology with his mother, Ana Maria Gordon, the sole survivor of the St. Louis living in Canada today. Ms. Gordon, who met with Mr. Trudeau privately, was surrounded by many of her great-grandchildren and grandchildren. Last week, Mr. Trudeau apologized to a British Columbia First Nation for the government\u2019s treachery in inviting six Tsilhqot\u2019in chiefs to peace talks 150 years ago. Instead of talking, the government arrested them, put them on trial and hanged them. He has also apologized to Omar Khadr, the only Canadian who was held at the United States military base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. He emotionally apologized to gay members of the army, the police and in public service who were persecuted \u2014 some even imprisoned \u2014 because of their sexual orientation. And he tearfully said sorry to indigenous people in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, where for much of the 20th century indigenous children were torn from their families and compelled to attend boarding schools, where many were abused. \u201cYou will not remove the guilt from the perpetrators of the horror,\u201d Mr. Gruner said. \u201cBut at least you can come to terms with what the country was at the time, and try to understand where we are at this particular time and where we want to be.\u201d Judith Steel, an 80-year-old grandmother from Queens, traveled to Ottawa to witness Mr. Trudeau\u2019s apology. She was 14 months old when she boarded the St. Louis with her parents. They ended up in France, where she was hidden for the duration of the war. Both her parents were sent to Auschwitz in occupied Poland, and murdered. \u201cI felt the prime minister\u2019s heart. He was just so open and honest,\u201d said Ms. Steel, who cried throughout Wednesday\u2019s ceremony. \u201cApologies are a very big part of my life,\u201d said Ms. Steel, who immigrated to the United States after the war to be raised by her aunt and uncle. \u201cWhat eats you up is the anger, the fear and all the emotions that go with loss. We have to forgive \u2014 not for them, but for ourselves.\u201d On Wednesday, Mr. Trudeau mentioned the growing anti-Semitism that has bubbled up in Canada, as it has in the United States, and vowed to stamp it out. \u201cCanada and all Canadians must stand up against xenophobic and anti-Semitic attitudes that still exist in our community, in our schools and in our places of work,\u201d he said. Canada\u2019s policy toward Jews during and after World War II was exposed by two university professors, first in an academic paper and later in the 1982 book, \u201cNone Is Too Many: Canada and the Jews of Europe.\u201d Their findings had a profound effect on the country\u2019s psyche and directly influenced the Canadian government\u2019s decision to open its arms to Vietnamese refugees, accepting some 60,000 people fleeing the Communist government. That legacy continued as the country accepted around 58,000 refugees fleeing the Syrian war over the past three years. But after Mr. Trudeau tweeted that refugees were welcome in Canada, \"regardless of your faith,\u201d and asylum seekers began to flood across the border from the United States into Canada, the topic of immigration has become politically heated in the country again.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/world/canada/trudeau-apology-jews-st-louis.html", "date": "2018-11-07 00:00:00", "author": "By Catherine Porter", "description": "In 1939, Canada refused desperate pleas for asylum by the captain of the St. Louis, a ship with more than 900 passengers.

{"content": "DALLAS \u2014 The Dirk Nowitzki Farewell Tour is not yet underway in Dallas \u2014 for at least three reasons. For starters, Nowitzki is still recovering from an inflamed tendon in his left foot that flared up in the midst of his comeback from ankle surgery in April. There is also too much angst about the floundering Cowboys for the locals to fret too much (yet) about the Mavericks\u2019 3-7 start. And then there\u2019s the biggest reason: Nowitzki has not definitively stated that this season will be his last. He has said repeatedly that he will make that determination after his record-setting 21st consecutive season with a single N.B.A. team. Yet after covering Nowitzki since his first N.B.A. dribble with the Dallas Mavericks, I\u2019ve been pestering him \u2014 just in case this does prove to be his farewell campaign \u2014 to let me check in with him periodically to find out what he\u2019s feeling and thinking as one of two active 40-year-olds in the league alongside Vince Carter of the Atlanta Hawks. Here is the first of those chats. Q: You\u2019re still waiting to make your season debut. How are you coping with all the delays? Nowitzki: It\u2019s hard not being out there. It\u2019s what I love. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done. Throughout my entire career, I always tried to play all 82, no matter if I\u2019m sick or I rolled my ankle or whatever. I was only able to pull it off a couple of times in my career, but it was a pride thing. So for me, any time I had to sit out, it never feels right. And it\u2019s the same now, especially because it\u2019s been a rough start for us. You\u2019re in a suit and you\u2019re not as involved as you want to be. Hopefully once I\u2019m over this tendon thing then I won\u2019t look back again for the rest of the season. Q: You opted to have ankle surgery before the end of last season to try to get a head start on the recovery process. How much does that add to your frustration? Nowitzki: The one guy I actually talked to a lot about this was Vince. He warned me. He had this same procedure. He had some huge bone spurs taken out a few years ago and he always said it\u2019s a long road back. First of all, we\u2019re old. Second of all, your body is used to having those bone spurs. And now all of a sudden everything is new. Recovery was going fine. I was already scrimmaging and running and doing all that stuff in September. And then the tendon just reacted. It is frustrating, but I understand. I don\u2019t heal like a 20-year-old. I\u2019ve played more than 50,000 minutes and that\u2019s just the regular season. The good thing is that it\u2019s only the start of November. If this was February or March, I\u2019d be a lot more frustrated. But I\u2019m hoping I can come back in a few weeks, and there\u2019s still plenty of basketball left. Q: No one is more qualified to evaluate Luka Doncic than you. What do you see so far? Nowitzki: He\u2019s like a savvy veteran to me already. The way he sees things. The way he reads pick-and-roll situations. The way he carries himself on and off the floor. He\u2019s got the midrange game. He shot like four floaters against San Antonio that were money. He\u2019s got the stepback 3. He\u2019s got stuff in his repertoire that you just don\u2019t have at 19. The whole floor game that he has \u2014 he really has no holes. If you go under the screen and roll, he shoots the 3-ball way better than I thought he would. If you go over, he kind of keeps you on his back. He\u2019s got the floater. He\u2019s got the passes. Really, really impressive for a 19-year-old. The sky\u2019s the limit. Q: Even though you\u2019re both from Europe and both came to the N.B.A. at a young age, Luka has the ball in his hands all the time and you have always been a finisher. So doesn\u2019t that make it harder to mentor him when you play such different games? Nowitzki: He\u2019s a very confident player already. He was a full-on pro since he was, I don\u2019t know, 14 years old. He lived in a different country before he even came here. His English is good. He feels like, in his head, he\u2019s running the show already. He carries himself like a true vet. So we have a great time. He\u2019s a good kid. But so far he doesn\u2019t really ask me much. He just plays his game. I didn\u2019t have that confidence, that swag, when I got in the league. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to make it in this league. This guy comes here basically knowing he\u2019s going to make it in the league. And that\u2019s how he carries himself on the court. No fear. It\u2019s just completely different. Also the way the game is now is kind of perfect for him. When I got into the league 20 years ago, it was way more physical. The bigs were just shoving in there and holding. And now everything is a foul call. So I think the rules play right into his wheelhouse. It\u2019s not even close to compare us. Q: I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re as light as you\u2019ve been since your rookie season \u2014 right in the 240-pound range. How and why did you do it? Nowitzki: I just didn\u2019t want to be too heavy before coming back. So for the summer I did a couple fasting rounds. And then while I\u2019m not playing I\u2019m doing this intermittent fasting thing where you basically eat for eight hours and then fast for 16. In the morning I work out without having breakfast \u2014 just black coffee. My first meal is not until 12 or 12:30. Obviously, you could never do that while you\u2019re playing. You need nutrition in the morning, you need food, before practicing. Q: How much grief are you taking from teammates about LeBron James passing you for No. 6 on the all-time scoring list before you had a chance to pass Wilt Chamberlain at No. 5? Nowitzki: Everybody knew that was happening. Some of the guys were already calling me \u201cSeven\u201d last season because of the pace LeBron was on. He\u2019s one of the all-time greats. If he doesn\u2019t slow down, like I said before, he\u2019s going to end up 1 or 2. I\u2019m probably going to tell him when I see him that I\u2019m going to try to catch him, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to happen. The good thing is, like our P.R. guy Scott Tomlin always tells me, when I finally get back to No. 6, we\u2019ve got all the merchandise already made \u2014 all the T-shirts, all the bobbleheads, all the gear. So it\u2019s a perfect situation.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/sports/dirk-nowitzki-lebron-james.html", "date": "2018-11-07 00:00:00", "author": "By Marc Stein", "description": "Nowitzki has yet to play this season as he recovers from an ankle injury, but he has plenty to say about chasing LeBron, off-season dieting and Dallas Mavericks rookie Luka Doncic.", "title": "Dirk Nowitzki Knew LeBron Would Pass Him, but He\u2019s Still Gunning for Wilt"},
{"content": "PHOENIX \u2014 Two states sent the first Native American women to Congress. Another elected its first Native American lieutenant governor. A Navajo candidate won a pivotal county race in an area long dominated by a white minority. Native Americans notched historic electoral wins on Tuesday, in a country where indigenous people were not granted the right to vote until 1924. The victories, in an array of federal, state and local races, did not come easily. They took decades of grass-roots organizing, legal battles to redraw voting districts favoring white candidates, new sources of campaign money and the harnessing of visceral reactions to President Trump\u2019s use of slurs against Native Americans. And they took strong candidates with a winning combination of political credentials and personal experiences that resonated with voters. \u201cThe candidates themselves were just exceptional in this year\u2019s races,\u201d said Mellor Willie, a founder of 7Gen Leaders, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d formed this year to bolster emerging Native American political leaders. \u201cBut it often comes down to money, and that\u2019s where we came in.\u201d 7Gen Leaders was a crucial source of financing for the two Native American women elected this week to the United States House of Representatives: Deb Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, a community organizer and a member of Laguna Pueblo; and Sharice Davids, Democrat of Kansas, a former mixed martial arts fighter and a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation. \u201cThese are Native women who have paid their dues for years to make this moment happen,\u201d said Mr. Willie, whose organization receives funding from abortion rights activists and tribes including the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation of California and the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community of Minnesota. Ms. Haaland cut her teeth for years as a community organizer and as the chairwoman of New Mexico\u2019s Democratic Party. She came out swinging against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown, discussed the challenges of being a single mother and promoted indigenous sovereignty as a professed \u201c35th-generation New Mexican.\u201d In a relatively liberal district encompassing Albuquerque, that messaging worked. \u201cI\u2019ve been organizing in New Mexico for close to 20 years, so it\u2019s not like people weren\u2019t familiar with me or what I stand for,\u201d Ms. Haaland, 57, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cWe have an extremely divisive president who disparages so many people. I felt like it was just time to stand up with a positive campaign.\u201d Another congressional race in New Mexico involving a Native American candidate was decided on Wednesday night, with the Republican, Yvette Herrell, a member of the Cherokee Nation, losing to Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat and water rights lawyer, after absentee ballots were counted. Unlike many Native American politicians in other races, Ms. Herrell did not promote her indigenous heritage while campaigning. In Kansas, Ms. Davids can add another first to the record books: She is the first openly lesbian candidate to be elected to Congress from the state. She attended Cornell Law School and was a White House fellow in the Obama administration before mounting a campaign highlighting her heritage, sexual orientation and martial-arts mettle. \u201cIt\u2019s 2018 and women, Native Americans, gay people, the unemployed and underemployed have to fight like hell to survive,\u201d Ms. Davids, 38, said in one of her campaign ads. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Trump and the Republicans in Washington don\u2019t give a damn about anyone like me or anyone who doesn\u2019t think like them.\u201d Jean Schroedel, a professor of political science at Claremont Graduate University in California, who studies Native American voting rights, said Ms. Davids\u2019s campaign offered a blueprint for other candidates seeking to frame issues from a Native American perspective. \u201cSharice not only won but just took out a rising star of the Republican Party,\u201d Professor Schroedel said, referring to Ms. Davids\u2019s opponent, Representative Kevin Yoder, a four-term incumbent who championed conservative causes. \u201cDemocrats have been targeting that seat for several cycles and she showed them how to get it done.\u201d The election of Ms. Haaland and Ms. Davids will double the number of Native Americans in Congress. They will join two Republicans from Oklahoma, Tom Cole, a member of the Chickasaw Nation, and Markwayne Mullin, of the Cherokee Nation. Native American voters and candidates still face several challenges, and not all won on Tuesday. Paulette Jordan, a Democrat and a member of the Coeur d\u2019Alene, was trying to become the first Native American governor but lost her race in Idaho. And a new law in North Dakota that required voters to have a residential address effectively made it harder for many Native Americans who rely on post office boxes. The Supreme Court upheld the law in October. Still, Native American voters, who tend to support Democrats, turned out in relatively large numbers in parts of North Dakota. That was not enough to prevent Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic incumbent, from losing the race. Some observers cited Ms. Heitkamp\u2019s ambiguous positioning on the Dakota Access pipeline, the focus of tense protests by many Native Americans in North Dakota, as complicating her re-election bid. Congressional victories in the midterms drew the most attention, but Native American political organizers say that advances at the state and local levels were just as crucial. They cited continuing battles to enfranchise voters across the country who have long been marginalized. States including New Mexico and Arizona effectively barred many Native Americans from voting for decades after they were given the right in the 1920s. Elsewhere, districts were gerrymandered to bolster white candidates. In San Juan County in southeastern Utah, where Native Americans have long outnumbered white people, Navajo Democrats waged a protracted legal battle to realign voting districts to better reflect the county\u2019s population. A federal judge in 2017 ordered the county to redraw boundaries to give Navajos a majority in two of three county commission districts. The battle did not end there: Republicans in the county tried to prevent a Navajo candidate, Willie Grayeyes, from running for county commission this year, saying he lived across the Utah border in Arizona. Officials removed Mr. Grayeyes from the ballot before a federal court determined that a county clerk had falsified documentation in the case. Mr. Grayeyes appeared on the ballot on Tuesday.

{"content": "HAMBURG \u2014 One reason Schumann\u2019s \u201cScenes From Goethe\u2019s \u2018Faust\u2019\u201d is so rarely performed is its hybrid shape: part literary oratorio, part opera. Another handicap is his selections. While other composers drawn to Goethe\u2019s tragedy about a dissatisfied man who makes a pact with the devil have focused on the dark scenes from Part I \u2014 Faust\u2019s ruinous love for Gretchen and the destructive vortex of events wrought by Mephistopheles \u2014 Schumann set his sights on the epilogue in heaven. Here Goethe imagines a metaphysical tug-of-war over Faust\u2019s soul that zooms toward redemption in a way that is brainy, sublime and devilishly hard to stage. An entrancing new production by Achim Freyer for the Hamburg State Opera, though, argues that it\u2019s well worth trying. Mr. Freyer, an artist and director with a penchant for dense symbolism, takes a restrained approach to this overlooked gem. He conjures a world that, for all its surreal touches, has a zany beauty that gently smooths over Schumann\u2019s dramatic flaws. Mr. Freyer places the orchestra, choir, children\u2019s chorus and most of the soloists on stage behind a black scrim. In front of the scrim, atop where the orchestra pit has been covered, actors in dark clothes and green faces move in slow motion, carrying and rearranging objects: a tin drum, a cutout of a church, the blue flower that was a key symbol of German Romanticism. Between scrim and covered pit, blocking the audience\u2019s view of the conductor, is a stylized copy of \u201cThe Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog,\u201d Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s painting of a man, seen from behind, looking out over swirling mists. Mr. Freyer\u2019s \u201cWanderer,\u201d though, is missing its head. By stepping behind the copy, Mr. Gerhaher\u2019s Faust could merge with the painted seeker \u2014 either while gazing through the scrim toward the dark mystery of music, or out at the detritus of life and, beyond, the judgment of the audience. As with so many classic works of Romanticism, Friedrich\u2019s image came to be co-opted by the Nazis as a symbol of national exceptionalism. Thus the duality in Faust \u2014 knowledge and destruction \u2014 blends with the duality of the Romantic mountaineer who is the model of, simultaneously, contemplation and conquest. The shadowy stage workers creep about cradling objects that sometimes seed a wealth of associations and sometimes pull into focus a narrative thread dropped by Schumann. A fragment of Goethe\u2019s color wheel, a kabbalistic tetragram, and two dwarves with a Snow White apple all appear and vanish. But in Schumann\u2019s most operatic scene, in which Gretchen prays in church, plagued by guilt, a pantomime of props tells the full story. Bloodied rags, a naked baby doll, and a pair of wings remind the audience that the desperate Gretchen killed her illegitimate child in desperation. Schumann assembles that scene brilliantly, with the solo soprano (here the glowingly effusive Christina Gansch) offset by a churning orchestra, taunted by Mephisto (Franz-Josef Selig, singing with kid-glove sarcasm). Soon the choir muscles in with a ferocious \u201cDies irae.\u201d The composer wields his large forces in a way that doesn\u2019t overpower individual voices or the text. In the magisterial baritone Christian Gerhaher he found an interpreter able to let Goethe\u2019s densely brilliant lines shine through the music. Mr. Gerhaher has the power to project clarion vigor where needed. But more often his voice seems to become a vehicle for the words, with some passages delivered with a tone so lightened of vibrato that it approached the near-spoken style more commonly heard in modernist works. In the latter part of the evening, when he embodied the allegorical Dr. Marianus, whose worship of the Holy Virgin paves the way for Faust\u2019s redemption, Mr. Gerhaher\u2019s voice turned velvet and weightless. The final apotheosis is a magnificent blend of soloists, choir and orchestra that pays homage to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy.\u201d By then Mr. Freyer\u2019s objects had been abstracted into geometric shapes of pure color, while video projections of the faces of Faust and Gretchen drifted upward on the scrim. It would have been nice to lift that scrim for the applause, which the ensemble musicians rightfully shared with the soloists. The conductor Kent Nagano, who had led a burnished reading of the exquisite score, came to the front for his bow. But the choir and orchestra remained partially obscured in Mr. Freyer\u2019s realm of music and mystery.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/arts/music/review-achim-freyer-schumann-faust.html", "date": "2018-11-07 00:00:00", "author": "By Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim", "description": "Achim Freyer\u2019s production in Hamburg conjures a world that, for all its surreal touches, has a zany beauty that gently smooths over Schumann\u2019s flaws.", "title": "Review: A Rare Staging Finds the Magic in Schumann\u2019s \u2018Faust\u2019"},

In describing what led to the shooting, the statement merely said: \u201cThey asked their grandson to clean his room and pick up after himself throughout the day, as he was being stubborn about it.\u201d The statement said that the authorities were still investigating, but added that there had been no previous signs that the grandson might harm himself or someone else \u201cand there was no cause for concern prior to this event.\u201d Sergeant Enriquez did not reply to questions on Tuesday about what type of handgun had been used, how the child had access to it, and whether there would be any charges related to the incident.

{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A top official of the American Cancer Society has resigned in part because of concern over some of the organization\u2019s fund-raising partnerships. The official, Dr. Otis W. Brawley, an executive vice president and chief medical officer, resigned his post late last week after 11 years at the society. His departure was largely attributed to his dismay over some commercial partnerships, including with Herbalife International, the controversial supplements company, people close to him said. While he would not comment publicly, others said that he had become uncomfortable with the society\u2019s growing reliance on donations from businesses with questionable health credentials that he and others suspect are seeking to burnish their images. Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer at the society, said Dr. Brawley\u2019s resignation had hit his colleagues hard. \u201cIt\u2019s personally difficult and certainly for many in the organization it\u2019s difficult as well,\u201d Dr. Lichtenfeld said. Such donations and fund-raising partnerships have become more important in recent years as the organization\u2019s fund-raising has declined. Fund-raising income has gone down every year since its peak of just over $1 billion in 2007. In 2017, donations reached only $736 million, although the society made up for some of the loss by selling properties. Critics in and outside the 105-year-old organization have also protested its recent partnerships with Long John Silver\u2019s, a seafood chain best known for its batter-fried fish; and Tilted Kilt, a sports pub showcasing \u201cKilt Girls\u201d in skimpy red plaid. And Herbalife International has had a troubled history. The company donated $250,000 directly to the cancer society, and in October, started selling pink water bottles, that are co-branded with both the American Cancer Society and the Herbalife logo. Proceeds from the sales all go to the cancer society. \u201cThese water bottles are really a good way for people to show their support,\u201d said Sharon Byers, the society\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cOur intent with all of our partnerships is to generate as much revenue as we can to achieve our mission.\u201d In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration told Herbalife to take down a YouTube video that featured a former F.D.A. official implying that the agency approved weight loss shakes and other supplements. And in a 2016 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, Herbalife agreed to pay $200 million and was forced to restructure the business to settle charges that it deceived customers into thinking they could make substantial money selling the product. Herbalife did not respond to numerous requests for comment. \u201cThe company is too controversial historically,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine. \u201cIt has a very non-illustrious history with regulatory bodies, association with a product of controversial and most likely dubious merit, and is not where the cancer society wants or ought to be.\u201d The Herbalife Facebook page shows both the cancer society and the company\u2019s logo, with the phrase, \u201cWorking Together to Make the World Healthier and Happier and Free from Breast Cancer.\u201d It does carry a disclaimer noting the cancer society does not endorse Herbalife products. Dr. Caplan said the disclaimer isn\u2019t enough. \u201cSome people are going to think that there\u2019s an implicit endorsement,\u201d he said, \u201ceither because they don\u2019t look at the website or they just see the bottle and presume a partnership.\u201d Historically, the cancer society\u2019s revenue was heavily reliant on walks, including Relay for Life and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer, said Michael Reich, a spokesman for the organization. But during the past decade, he said, donations patterns have changed and walks, in particular, have become less popular. \u201cBecause A.C.S.\u2019s walks generated so much revenue and were such a large part of our portfolio, our declines were much more pronounced than some other organizations,\u201d Mr. Reich said. \u201cWe have been re-engineering and diversifying our revenue portfolio, and partnerships are playing a key role. This takes time to build, but we are making tremendous progress.\u201d Ms. Byers, the cancer society\u2019s chief marketing officer, said the organization does not form alliances with tobacco companies, but other than that, assesses each company individually. Mr. Reich also defended the arrangement with the Tilted Kilt. \u201cI can tell you that A.C.S. is proud of the partnership with Tilted Kilt, too,\u201d Mr. Reich said. \u201cWe do not yet have a plan for 2019, but we would certainly work with them again.\u201d Responding to internal criticism about the Tilted Kilt, Mr. Reich said, \u201cWe know we\u2019re taking some risks. Not every partnership or initiative is for everyone.\u201d Janet Wilt, marketing director for the restaurant chain, said she was proud the company was a donor. \u201cCancer is a disease that has touched all of our lives and it does not discriminate based on who you are or where you work,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cFrankly, we are disappointed people are offended by any organization supporting efforts toward finding a cure.\u201d The cancer society is not the only patient advocacy group struggling to expand its donor base without becoming tainted by associations with other groups. A Boston University study two years ago identified scores of patient advocacy groups and other health organizations, including the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association, that accepted research funding from soda companies. One of the cancer society\u2019s new donors, Long John Silver\u2019s, was the subject of criticism for its use of trans fats, which it has since dropped. James P. O\u2019Reilly, the company\u2019s chief executive, notes that the restaurant now offers healthier choices, among them baked shrimp and cod and grilled salmon, and is expanding its grilled selections on the menu. \u201cLong John Silver\u2019s and its franchisees are proud to stand with the many millions of American families who battle cancer every day,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said in an email. Jonathan H. Marks, associate professor of bioethics, humanities and law at Pennsylvania State University, pointed to the partnership\u2019s conflicting messages. \u201cThe partnership with Long John Silver\u2019s undermines the integrity of the American Cancer Society,\u201d Dr. Marks said. \u201cThe American Cancer Society\u2019s website encourages readers to prepare fish and poultry by baking, broiling or poaching rather than by frying or charbroiling. But the society is partnering with a fast food company whose leading menu items are fried. Integrity requires consistency.\u201d Dr. Brawley, 59, said he was not able to discuss the terms of his departure. Members of the society said he also had concerns about the administration of its landmark program to make cancer drugs available at lower cost in Africa.

This time, when Stephen Colbert broke out the bourbon, it was only to mourn the defeat of one Senate candidate. He\u2019s seen much worse. In 2016, broadcasting live on Election Day, he was stunned by the defeat of Hillary Clinton \u2014 and his uncorking of the booze became the symbolic beginning of late-night TV\u2019s reckoning with a Trump presidency. On Tuesday, again broadcasting live as the midterm election results came in, Colbert reported, with relief, that Democrats had won control of the House. Then he delivered the news that Ted Cruz of Texas \u2014 a favorite late-night punching bag \u2014 had defeated his challenger for the Senate, Beto O\u2019Rourke, and all of a sudden Colbert was reaching for an \u201cemergency drink\u201d again, dramatically breaking the glass on a box guarding his tumbler. [On midterm TV, waves of data, whiplashing narrative and nausea, our critic writes.] Colbert expressed excitement that the Democrats\u2019 new majority would allow them to control the House\u2019s investigation into President Trump\u2019s finances and his ties to Russia. But with Republicans controlling the rest of the federal government, he cautioned against excess optimism. Colbert rolled tape of a recent rally at which Trump seemed to proudly take credit for the high voter turnout in this election. It was a curious move, Colbert said, since many voters were motivated by their dislike for him. Trevor Noah and Jimmy Kimmel also broadcast live, and both said they had spent the day in agonizing suspense waiting for the returns. Kimmel\u2019s street squad persuaded innocent civilians that Kid Rock had been elected to the Senate (not true). Here\u2019s how they reacted. Colbert closed his broadcast with an all-star panel of guests \u2014 from left, the comedian Hasan Minhaj and the journalists John Heilemann and Alex Wagner, below \u2014 discussing what comes next.

The latest example was on Tuesday, when athletes, actors, musicians and those famous for being famous joined ordinary Americans to vote on Election Day. They waited in long lines, filled out ballots and shared \u201cI Voted\u201d photos \u2014 just like the rest of us. In past years, midterm elections have typically drawn far less interest among all voters, including celebrities, and turnout at the polls has dipped in off-years between presidential elections. But this year is different. An energized and polarized electorate is fired up \u2014 and celebrities are playing a big part, both at campaign rallies and on social media, to get people engaged. More than 31.5 million people were estimated to have voted early across the United States, with 22 states and the District of Columbia surpassing total turnout in the last midterm four years ago. [See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors\u2019 races.] \u201cI voted because I honor those that have fought and died for these rights,\u201d the singer Pink wrote on Instagram on Tuesday. \u201cIn order to have an opinion, you must participate. I voted. Go be loud.

The singer Melissa Etheridge shared a selfie with her \u201cI Voted,\u201d as did the actress Melissa McCarthy and Jimmy Fallon. The actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California, encouraged people bring friends out to vote too. \u201cGet to the polls!\u201d Mr. Schwarzenegger said in a video he shared on Twitter. Beyonc\u00e9 posted to Instagram three times wearing a black cropped hoodie, black pants and a black and white hat with the name Beto emblazoned on it, in support of Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Texas. Beyonc\u00e9 is originally from Houston, but it was not clear where she had voted. \u201cEvery vote counts, every race matters, everywhere,\u201d she captioned one of her photos. Mike Sorrentino, the reality TV star known as \u201cThe Situation\u201d on \u201cJersey Shore\u201d who was sentenced in October to eight months in prison for tax evasion, advocated for voting. The former Disney stars Zendaya and Nick Jonas voted on Tuesday and showed off their stickers. A slew of celebrities voted early. Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns N\u2019 Roses, tweeted a photo of his mail-in ballot and said \u201cVote Blue\u201d \u2014 and then got an earful from fans who disagreed with his politics. Another outspoken music star, Taylor Swift, voted early after spending the past few weeks urging her fans to register to vote. (The website Vote.org said her campaign led to an increase in registrations on its site.) Ms. Swift, who had stayed silent for years about her political beliefs, said last month that she supported Democratic candidates in Tennessee, which she calls home. On Oct. 30, she announced on Instagram that she and her mother, Andrea Swift, had voted early in Tennessee for Phil Bredesen, the state\u2019s former Democratic governor now running for Senate. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] In an Instagram story on Tuesday, Ms. Swift, who had a concert in Australia on Election Day, told her fans that they would feel better about themselves if they voted. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just want change,\u201d Ms. Swift said. \u201cYou have to go and make change by voting. Today is your opportunity to do that.\u201d Demi Lovato posted a photo of herself at the voting booth to her Instagram account. \u201cI am so grateful to be home in time to vote!,\u201d Ms. Lovato captioned her photo. The post is the first time Ms. Lovato has posted anything to her social media accounts since she entered rehab after an episode that the authorities described as an overdose this past July. Mindy Kaling also posted a photo of herself sporting her \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker to her Instagram account. Ms. Kaling made light of the amendments that grant her birthright citizenship in her Instagram caption. \u201cThank you 14th & 19th Amendment for letting me vote today!,\u201d Ms. Kaling captioned her photo.

Leading up to Election Day, candidates across the country, from races for governor to those in the Senate, have attracted superstars to join them on the campaign trail. But for the most part, the big-name stars joined Democratic candidates. Case in point: Last week, Oprah Winfrey knocked on doors in Georgia with Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor.

On the eve of the election, early-voting numbers suggest that this could be a record-breaking year for midterm turnout.

{"content": "LOS LUNAS, N.M. \u2014 The tumultuous 2018 midterm campaign, shaped by conflicts over race and identity and punctuated by tragedy, barreled through its final weekend as voters prepared to deliver a verdict on the first half of President Trump\u2019s term, with Republicans bracing for losses in the House and state capitals but hopeful they would prevail in Senate races in areas where Mr. Trump is popular. The president was set to storm across two states Saturday, two Sunday and three Monday in an effort to pick off Senate seats in Indiana, Florida and a handful of other battlegrounds where Republicans hope to add to their one-seat majority in the chamber. Democrats and liberal activists, galvanized by opposition to Mr. Trump, gathered Saturday to knock on doors and make turnout calls from Pennsylvania to Illinois to Washington to try to erase the G.O.P.\u2019s 23-seat House majority. The run-up to the election, widely seen as a referendum on Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive persona and hard-line policy agenda, has revealed deep strains in the president\u2019s political coalition and left him confined to campaign in a narrow band of conservative communities. Republicans\u2019 intermittent focus on favorable economic news, such as the Friday report showing strong job growth, has been overwhelmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s message of racially incendiary nationalism. While Mr. Trump retains a strong grip on many red states and working-class white voters, his jeremiads against immigrants and penchant for ridicule have proved destabilizing, with the party losing more affluent whites and moderates in metropolitan areas key to control of the House. Republicans have grown increasingly pessimistic in recent days about holding the House, as polls show a number of incumbents lagging well below 50 percent and some facing unexpectedly close races in conservative-leaning districts. In several diverse Sun Belt states where Republicans had shown resilience, such as Texas, Florida and Arizona, their candidates have seen their numbers dip in polling as Mr. Trump has given up the unifying role that American presidents have traditionally tried to play. Democrats are also in contention to retain or capture governorships in rust belt states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that were pivotal to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and fertile ground for Republicans for much of the last decade. Despite these worrisome signs, some Republican leaders saw reason for measured optimism. While Mr. Trump said Friday that Republicans losing the House \u201ccould happen,\u201d Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who leads the G.O.P. House campaign committee, has continued to predict that his party will narrowly hold its majority. Republican strategists have argued that about two dozen races are within the margin of error in polling; should right-of-center voters swing back to them on Election Day, they say, Democrats could fall short of winning enough seats to take control of the House. Republican officials were more confident about their prospects in the Senate, where they had an opportunity to enlarge their majority in an otherwise difficult year. Nearly all of the most important Senate races are being fought on solidly conservative terrain, including North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana, where Democratic incumbents are in close contests for re-election. Mr. Trump won all three states by landslide margins in 2016. There was an unmistakable dissonance between the relative health of the economy and the dark mood of a country as voters prepared to go to the polls just days after a wave of attempted mail bombings and a massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead. \u201cThe nation is in political turmoil,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican facing a difficult re-election in part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity. \u201cThe economy is roaring but the mood is so sour. It\u2019s a very sad time in this country.\u201d The mood that has imperiled lawmakers like Mr. Curbelo has buoyed Democrats across the country. A class of first-time candidates has been lifted by an enormous surge of activism and political energy on the left, as a loose array of constituencies offended by Mr. Trump \u2014 including women, young people and voters of color \u2014 has mobilized with a force unseen in recent midterm elections. Early voting across the country reflected the intensity of the election: More than 28 million people had already cast ballots by the end of Friday, about 10 million more than at a comparable point in the 2014 midterm elections, according to the Democratic data firm Catalist. These voters have helped nominate a record number of female candidates for Congress and delivered Democrats a wide and unaccustomed financial advantage toward the end of the campaign. If Mr. Trump has animated a powerful national campaign against him, Democratic candidates have largely avoided engaging the president personally in the closing days of the election, instead hewing close to a few favored issues like health care. At a Saturday morning rally, Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, the head of the Democrats\u2019 campaign committee in the House, drummed home the party\u2019s ethos of ignoring Mr. Trump while riding the backlash against him. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have to even talk about this president \u2014 he\u2019s going to do all the talking about himself, for himself,\u201d Mr. Luj\u00e1n said, addressing volunteers in Los Lunas, where Democrats are making a push to pick up an open House seat. \u201cI want you to concentrate on families here in New Mexico.\u201d But Senator Martin Henrich, appearing beside Mr. Luj\u00e1n and Xochitl Torres Small, a water-use lawyer who is the Democratic nominee for Congress, cast the election in dire terms familiar to anxious Democrats across the country. \u201cThis is a battle for who we are as a nation,\u201d said Mr. Heinrich, who is expected to win re-election easily on Tuesday. That mind-set on the left has given Democrats an upper hand in campaign fund-raising. Political spending in the election is expected to exceed $5 billion, making it the most costly midterm contest in history, according to a report by the Center for Responsive Politics. The report found that Democratic candidates for the House had raised more money than their Republican competitors, by a margin of more than $300 million. But many Senate Democrats have also decisively outraised their contenders, a sobering reminder to Republican officials about the rise of small-dollar and billionaire contributors on the left. \u201cIf alarm bells aren\u2019t ringing across the Republican landscape as a result of the dollars Democrats have raised and the mechanism they raised them with, then we don\u2019t deserve the majority,\u201d said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, who oversees the Senate Republican campaign arm. Mr. Gardner warned that the Democrats\u2019 newfound fund-raising prowess could buffet his party even more in 2020, when a less-inviting list of seats is up for election \u2014 including his own. \u201cWe may be able to survive with this map in 2018, but we cannot survive that map in 2020,\u201d he said. It is the House, though, where Republicans face greater peril. Most critical to determining control of the chamber are likely to be prosperous, culturally dynamic suburbs \u2014 around cities like New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles \u2014 where Republicans are defending several dozen districts packed with voters in open revolt against Mr. Trump. Democrats have won over many swing voters in these areas with a message focused on Republican health care and tax policies that are even less popular than the president himself. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can find a race in the country where health care hasn\u2019t been a dominant issue,\u201d the Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said. The fate of Republican lawmakers in the East Coast suburbs could offer an early harbinger on election night of whether the party can maintain even a tenuous grip on the House. Many of those communities could also tip powerful governorships into Democratic hands for the first time in a decade. Former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, the last Democrat to lead that state, said the election had effectively become a referendum on Mr. Trump, leaving Democrats \u201cconfident about the House and a little concerned about the Senate.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s on the ballot, regardless of whether his name is there or not,\u201d Mr. Strickland said of the president. Mr. Trump added that the shift in the political climate between 2016 and 2018 was like \u201cthe difference between heaven and hell.\u201d Mr. Trump has appeared to turn his attention in the last few days away from the effort to keep control of the House, and toward shoring up Republicans in coveted Senate races. He has focused predominantly on electrifying the right rather than soothing some of the swing voters who backed him over Hillary Clinton two years ago. In the final weeks of campaigning, Mr. Trump has delivered slashing attacks on immigration, railing against birthright citizenship, linking immigration without evidence to violent crime and amplifying debunked conspiracy theories about a migrant caravan in Latin America. In a possible portent of how he might react to electoral defeat, Mr. Trump lashed out at House Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Twitter after Mr. Ryan criticized his dubious proposal to void the constitutional guarantee of citizenship to anyone born on American soil. Mr. Trump\u2019s approach may resonate in several of the states with the closest Senate races, though it has the potential to backfire in several diverse states where Republican-held seats are at risk, including Nevada, Arizona and Texas. \u201cIt turns off independent voters,\u201d said Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat and head of the Democratic Senate campaign arm, arguing that such states offered his party \u201ca narrow path\u201d to a majority. Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster, said the Democratic message, focused on health care, was \u201cmore relevant\u201d to most voters than what Mr. Trump was offering them in his final argument. Likening the election to a tug of war, Ms. Matthews said the president was trying to energize his predominantly white and male base even as moderate women recoil from him. \u201cOn one end, you\u2019ve got white college-educated women pulling hard, pulling back from what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Ms. Matthews said. \u201cOn the other side of the rope, you\u2019ve got non-college-educated men pulling hard in the other direction.\u201d Even before his lunge toward culture-war rhetoric, Mr. Trump and his party appeared to be receiving scant political advantage from the state of the economy, which has grown steadily during his presidency and pushed the unemployment rate below 4 percent. A dip in the stock market over the final weeks of the campaign appeared to frustrate Mr. Trump, who suggested on Twitter \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that it reflected investors\u2019 concerns about a Democratic takeover. At no point this fall has a majority of voters approved of Mr. Trump, and while some surveys have shown improvement in his standing recently, the Gallup poll found at the end of October that just 2 in 5 Americans rated his performance favorably. If many of the most closely watched elections are at the federal level, governors\u2019 races around the country may be the most consequential elections, long term, for both parties. Democrats are hoping to elect a history-making set of candidates, including Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida, who would be the first African-Americans to lead their states. And Republicans are struggling to defend their dominance across Midwestern state governments, from Michigan and Ohio to Wisconsin and Iowa. Should Democrats capture several of those governorships, it could help them redraw congressional district lines to their advantage after 2020. And Republican losses at the state level could complicate Mr. Trump\u2019s path to re-election, strengthening the opposition party in crucial battlegrounds where he failed to consolidate support after the 2016 election. But it was the bifurcated maps this year between House and Senate that made 2018 so unusual, with Republicans from different regions sounding as if they hailed from two opposing parties when discussing Mr. Trump. \u201cIf we pick up seats, he\u2019s going to be the only reason why,\u201d Mr. Gardner said, crediting Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive campaigning in red-state Senate races. Yet Mr. Curbelo, who like many of the most endangered House Republicans represents a metropolitan area, portrayed the president as a mildly irritating but distant bystander. \u201cRepublicans are running their own races in each of their districts while the president is talking about topics important to him,\u201d he said with a wry chuckle.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/us/politics/elections-trump-congress.html", "date": "2018-11-03 00:00:00", "author": "By Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin", "description": "Republicans have grown increasingly pessimistic about holding the House, as polls show a number of incumbents lagging well below 50 percent.

{"content": "Innes, a youthful German shepherd, was trying to make his way across a frenetic Manhattan intersection near Central Park and found himself facing down all sorts of projectiles \u2014 yellow cabs, bike messengers, pedicabs \u2014 as a deafening truck horn blasted and the traffic light changed against him. But Innes was not negotiating this chaotic scene while out for an afternoon stroll. He was safeguarding his new master, Kathy Faul, 73, a blind woman from Swarthmore, Pa. Both were relative strangers to New York City, but they had ventured into Manhattan expressly for moments like this, to experience its particular brand of street-level chaos, as the culmination of a thorough course of training by the Seeing Eye, a guide dog school in Morristown, N.J. Founded in 1929, it is the nation\u2019s oldest training school for dogs and one of the largest of its kind. It even holds the trademark for the phrase \u201cseeing eye.\u201d The school\u2019s training is done in a suburban setting far calmer than Midtown Manhattan, an hour\u2019s drive away. But for its ultimate challenge, and to assess a dog\u2019s focus, trainers take the student-dog pairs into Manhattan as something of a proving ground. \u201cThere\u2019s no more intense place than New York City to train the dogs \u2014 it\u2019s the craziest environment they\u2019ve ever been in,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Neal, a Seeing Eye trainer. \u201cAt the end of the training, the idea is, \u2018O.K., they know the basics. Now can they handle the grind of the city?\u2019 \u201d To find out, Ms. Faul and another blind woman, Val Gee, 26, had arrived in a van to experience these extreme urban conditions, along with their dogs. \u201cI\u2019m half scared, half so excited,\u201d said Ms. Faul, gripping the stiff leather handle strapped to Innes. \u201cBut I figure, like the song says, if I can make it here, I can make it anywhere.\u201d Making it here involves navigating obstacles and potential hazards, from potholes to work zones to throngs of distracted pedestrians \u2014 not to mention the traffic madness Ms. Faul was now experiencing, which included a close encounter between Innes and a horse and buggy. To their credit, Ms. Faul and Innes remained calm. She nudged Innes back on course, so he could lead her to the curb safely. They had begun the route in a rooftop parking lot above the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the starting point of a loop plotted specifically \u201cto get them the best distractions,\u201d said Ms. Faul\u2019s trainer, Kristen DeMarco. After squeezing into a packed elevator, they were soon slipping through subway turnstiles and being led by their dogs through crowds of commuters. They braved a packed stairway to the train platform, while being jostled by crowds. The dogs remained calm on the subway platform, despite the clatter of passing trains and the blare of announcements. \u201cShe keeps her focus really well,\u201d Ms. Gee said, patting Ozma, a retriever mix. For Ms. Gee, a psychotherapist from Dayton, Ohio, this was only her second time in New York City, after visiting as a 19-year-old when being paired with her first guide dog, which she recently retired. \u201cThis is quite different from Dayton,\u201d said Ms. Gee who, with her instructor, Kristen Oplinger, boarded an uptown C train and sat next to a sleeping passenger, while Ozma curled up under the seat. At Columbus Circle, they headed up the escalator to the street. The first test was neither traffic- nor pedestrian-related, but rather a tiny dog that was being walked nearby and intrigued Innes. It would be the first of many tests of the dogs\u2019 concentration. There would also be countless new smells, from well-visited fire hydrants to aromatic street vendors. The sidewalks themselves were obstacle courses, with open basement doors creating gaping shaftways. There were gridlocked intersections, fluttering pigeons and jackhammers loud enough to interfere with dog-owner communication. Columbus Circle was flooded with lunchtime crowds. The first challenge was the traffic rotary. The dogs stopped at the curb, as they were trained, and both Ms. Faul and Ms. Gee listened to the flow of traffic, to detect if the cars had stopped for the light. Then each gave her dog a forward command and proceeded to cross. The dogs receive four months of training at the Seeing Eye, learning to guide around obstacles and obey commands, as well as street-crossing skills, including how to watch for traffic and keep their handlers safe from vehicles that might be turning or running lights. Officials with the Seeing Eye said they pair roughly 260 dogs each year with blind people living in the United States and Canada. Most live in some urban environment \u2014 largely because of public transportation, walkability and other services \u2014 and a handful live in New York City. Dogs who do not prefer an urban setting can be paired with owners who tend not to be city-goers. Owners train alongside their dogs while boarding at the school for several weeks. Their stay culminates with the trip to Manhattan. While not exactly a test, Manhattan\u2019s conditions present the dogs with intense conditions that can help reveal training aspects to work on. \u201cIt\u2019s a training experience that offers more than anywhere else we can take them,\u201d said Dave Johnson, director of instruction and training at the Seeing Eye. \u201cAlmost anything can happen in one day in New York \u2014 it\u2019s a culmination of sensory overload, even for humans.\u201d The dogs partnered with Ms. Faul and Ms. Gee were handling it all pretty well. They wove through pedestrians like a slalom course. Like harried New Yorkers, the dogs seemed stymied by slow-walking tourists. They nudged up to them and waited for a narrow opening to lead their owners past. \u201cShe\u2019s so smooth about it,\u201d said Ms. Gee, who began losing her vision in early childhood because of a genetic disorder. Ms. Faul said she was happy with Innes\u2019s confidence. \u201cYou need to have that gumption,\u201d said Ms. Faul, a retired computer programmer who lost her sight in a car accident while in college. \u201cWhen I felt him go through those people, I knew he was a New Yorker.\u201d Ahead was a hot dog cart whose vendor was playing Middle Eastern music. Ms. Gee avoided the cart but hit her head on a plastic sign that was hanging off it. She circled Ozma back to remind him to see obstacles at eye level. Guiding Eyes For the Blind, in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., in Westchester County, and the Guide Dog Foundation in Smithtown, N.Y., on Long Island, also train dogs in Manhattan. Many other schools train dogs in urban environments. But New York stands apart, said Marion Gwizdala, president of the National Association of Guide Dog Users. \u201cMost cities,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t have the hustle and bustle of Midtown Manhattan.\u201d Even for dogs and owners who do not visit cities, urban training can help prepare them for chaotic situations, such as shopping malls or carnivals, he added. As Ms. Faul and Ms. Gee headed along Seventh Avenue, the dogs guided them around scaffolding supports that partially blocked sidewalks and around a work zone. The dogs looped around a Coca-Cola truck blocking a crosswalk and later avoided a yellow cab that swooped around a corner toward them. There were moments for instruction, too, as when Innes suddenly made a sharp right \u2014 toward the open door of a perfume store. The dogs would soon get used to such distractions, Ms. DeMarco said. For now, Ms. Faul pulled him back on course. As visual as Times Square is, with its billboards and swarm of activity, Ms. Faul said that its aural energy was also impressive. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a carnival city,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the noise, all the beeps, all the people, the different languages you hear. The noise echoes off the buildings. It\u2019s like being at Mardi Gras. Crowds of people everywhere.\u201d They walked by the TKTS booth selling theater tickets and headed past Broadway theaters. Ms. Gee praised the way Ozma ignored the blaring sirens and kept her away from creeping tour buses and rumbling dump trucks. \u201cShe seems to focus even better in the chaos,\u201d she said, adding that there was only one problem. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be disappointed when we go home.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/nyregion/guide-dogs-blind.html", "date": "2018-11-06 00:00:00", "author": "By Corey Kilgannon", "description": "A school for Seeing Eye dogs uses the chaos of New York City as its ultimate test when matching young dogs with their blind masters.", "title": "A Final Proving Ground for Guide Dogs to the Blind: Midtown Manhattan"},
{"content": "HERSHEY, Pa. \u2014 On a recent Friday night, Pennsylvania Republicans tucked into a catered meal at the Hershey Lodge as Donald Trump Jr. took the stage, following his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, in what has become their pattern on the campaign trail this fall. \u201cIf there\u2019s one question that Donald Trump lied to all of you in this room about \u2026\u201d the president\u2019s eldest son said to the hundreds of party officials at the annual fall state G.O.P. dinner. He trailed off as the room seemed to quiver with nervousness at the use of the word \u201clied.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m getting somewhere \u2014 it\u2019s not a gaffe, promise,\u201d Mr. Trump said to laughter. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing he lied about, it\u2019s that you\u2019d all be sick of winning.\u201d The line has become a staple at many of the 60 events the younger Mr. Trump has held since May for Republican candidates and committees, as he has emerged as one of the G.O.P.\u2019s most visible headliners in a challenging midterms climate for the party. It has also been a re-emergence of sort. After damaging headlines in 2017 about possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia and Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s role in the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Kremlin-connected Russians, the president\u2019s son is appealing to the Republican base anew and mostly ignoring the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, and all things Russia. He and Ms. Guilfoyle are instead radiating a carefree, tag-team vibe at events, in interviews and in a television ad for the super PAC supporting his father. Mr. Trump has echoed his father\u2019s attacks on Democrats, mocked President Barack Obama for talking about a magic wand solving problems \u2014 \u201cAbracadabra, buddy!\u201d Mr. Trump chuckled from the stage in Hershey \u2014 and stoked fear about the out-of-power party winning a House majority in Tuesday\u2019s elections. The president is \u201cthe first politician to ever get killed on a daily basis for doing everything he said he would do \u2014 it\u2019s mind boggling,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his speech. \u201cThe mistake we sometimes make is thinking he can do it alone. He can\u2019t.\u201d Visits from President Trump have been a double-edged sword for Republican candidates in certain states, who want his backing but who fear blanket media coverage of his controversial statements. A guest appearance by Donald Trump Jr. has become the next best thing for several candidates, some of whom he\u2019s campaigned for repeatedly in states like Montana (where his father holds a grudge against Senator Jon Tester, who is up for re-election), Ohio (a key part of the Trump 2016 victory), Nevada (a purple state that Mr. Trump would like to add to his column in 2020) and North Dakota and West Virginia (which, like the others, have high-profile Senate races this year). He is scheduled to headline six rallies in five states on Monday. The G.O.P. base, with whom Mr. Trump was a family ambassador when his father campaigned in 2016, is almost as protective of Mr. Trump as they are of his father, seeing him as a looser version whom they can relate to, someone who does not carry himself like a celebrity. As unfiltered and caution-free as his father is, Mr. Trump\u2019s online persona can be even more reflexive and abrasive, mocking his father\u2019s critics and seizing on instances of \u201chypocrisy.\u201d On Twitter, Mr. Trump has unapologetically defended Brett M. Kavanaugh, the new Supreme Court justice who faced sexual assault allegations, and claimed Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat from West Virginia, was late in his support of the justice \u2014 despite having decided to back Mr. Kavanaugh before some of his G.O.P. colleagues. Mr. Trump has also attacked news outlets with gusto and amplified conservative memes, including retweeting a conspiratorial thread about the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In recent days, he declared that Senator Angus King, independent from Maine, wants to \u201crepopulate Maine with Syrian and Somalian refugees.\u201d At times, he has irked White House aides by being so vocal. David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama and an architect of Mr. Obama\u2019s historic win in 2008, described the younger Mr. Trump as \u201chotheaded and even more unrestrained than his dad when it comes to mixing it up.\u201d \u201cIf Trump Sr. employs a dog whistle, Jr. favors a bullhorn, joyfully transmitting nutty conspiracy theories that even his dad might be hesitant to embrace,\u201d Mr. Axelrod added. Mr. Trump, 40, said in an interview that he did not regret his use of social media, which often outdoes the president\u2019s own. His father is \u201cteaching other conservatives to fight,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He focuses heavily on amplifying alternatives to established outlets that appeal to his father\u2019s base of support, including some that traffic in misinformation, scrolling through his Twitter feed repeatedly to look at what is being said. \u201cWe can fight back,\u201d he said of the lesson of his father\u2019s win. \u201cWe don\u2019t just have to lose. We don\u2019t just have to take it when they say you\u2019re one of the \u2018ists.\u2019 We can be right.\u201d As Mr. Trump travels with Republican politicians on the campaign trail far from Washington, questions about the special counsel investigation and the Trump Tower meeting that he held with a Russian lawyer are absent. \u201cI have literally never been asked about it on the trail,\u201d he said, adding that voters \u201crealize it\u2019s nonsense.\u201d \u201cI did what any business guy would do. I took an unsolicited meeting, sat there for 20 minutes, wasted my time,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview, saying the focus on it became a frenzy. (He said in 2017 that the meeting was primarily about Russian adoptions; a year later, President Trump said the meeting was to \u201cget information on an opponent,\u201d Hillary Clinton.) If anything, Mr. Trump appears unconcerned about what may come with the Mueller inquiry after the midterms. He noted that he had cooperated fully with congressional committees looking into the 2016 campaign. \u201cGuess who didn\u2019t plead the Fifth \u2014 me,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to invoking Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, which others connected to the investigations have done. He has remained focused on his travels and his road show with Ms. Guilfoyle. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely a force multiplier,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Ms. Guilfoyle, the ex-wife of the Democratic candidate for governor in California, Gavin Newsom, and his own constant companion since his recent split from his ex-wife, Vanessa. In Hershey, Ms. Guilfoyle told the crowd that her nickname for him, \u201cJunior Mints,\u201d would change to \u201cHershey\u2019s Kiss.\u201d \u201cDelicious,\u201d she added for effect. His fluency in the language of the Republican base, which comes more naturally to him than any other Trump family member besides the president, has prompted constant questions about whether he will run someday. \u201cPeople love to hear him. He\u2019s good at his delivery,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican from California, \u201cand he\u2019s got the passion of what he\u2019s fighting for, but he connects with the average person.\u201d Mr. Trump said he is not trying to blanket the field with appearances \u2014 he is ruthless about not helping candidates who are lost causes \u2014 and he makes his picks based on a few specific criteria. \u201cThere are two things I\u2019m going to help people for \u2014 one is they\u2019ve been exceptionally good to my father, the administration or me personally,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s what the numbers tell me.\u201d Republicans say he has made a difference, both in closed-door fund-raisers and on the stump, because he\u2019s able to be at ease with both audiences. \u201cHe\u2019s like a relief pitcher \u2014 kind of loose and relaxed and easy to hang around with,\u201d said Jeff Roe, the Republican strategist and general consultant for a number of high-profile races this year. \u201cAnd all the sudden he comes in and throws 100 miles-per-hour fastballs.\u201d Mr. Roe said that Mr. Trump \u201chas to find a place to live, and he has to find a place he\u2019d enjoy, because he has to run for office.\u201d Mr. Trump says he is asked questions about his own future \u201cevery day,\u201d but if there\u2019s a specific office he would be drawn to, he didn\u2019t say. His supporters have mentioned possible runs for statewide office, almost certainly in red states where his father performed well. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m focused on other things, but you never know. I love the intensity of campaigning,\u201d he said. \u201cI love aspects of the fight. I don\u2019t know how much I would love aspects of the actual job yet.\u201d On the stump, he excoriates democratic socialism and tethers it to the form of socialism practiced in Eastern Europe, where his Czech-born mother, Ivana, sent her children to see her parents for over a decade when they were growing up. Mr. Trump said his grandmother watches democratic socialism described on cable news and says her views \u2014 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand how bad it is, you don\u2019t know what happens,\u201d he recalled her saying \u2014 have shaped his. While his father has taken over the G.O.P., Mr. Trump said he is mindful that there are still holdouts within the administration who miss the days before the Trump administration. \u201cI think there\u2019s still plenty of people that are still old-school, established people that want those things back,\u201d he said, \u201ceven if it means going back to losing.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-republicans-elections.html", "date": "2018-11-05 00:00:00", "author": "By Maggie Haberman", "description": "The president\u2019s eldest son has been an active campaigner for Republicans this year.

{"content": "Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Election Day is finally upon us. As California \u2014 and the nation \u2014 awaits the results, here is what you need to know to follow the day\u2019s events. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Californians voting on Election Day can find their polling place here, on the California Secretary of State\u2019s website. The New York Times has reporters stationed throughout the state: \u2022 Jose A. Del Real will be following congressional races in the Central Valley, particularly the 10th District contest between the Republican incumbent, Jeff Denham, and the Democratic challenger, Josh Harder. It\u2019s a seat the Democrats have high hopes of flipping. \u2022 Jennifer Medina will be in Orange County, where Democrats have targeted several seats long held by Republicans. \u2022 Thomas Fuller will be in Los Angeles following the governor\u2019s race, in which Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has the edge in the polls against the Republican businessman John Cox. \u2022 Tim Arango will be in San Diego, where critics say the indicted Republican incumbent Duncan Hunter has waged a campaign based on fear and racist undertones against his challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar. \u2022 Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, will be in New York, lending his political expertise to our national coverage. For voters looking for a refresher on the major issues and candidates in California, we have plenty to read: \u2022 In the governor\u2019s race, we profiled Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox. \u2022 For a look at the Latino electorate, and how it could factor into the results, read this article from the Central Valley and Nevada. \u2022 We profiled Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic voice of moderation in a state swinging farther to the left, who is most likely running her last campaign. \u2022 Over the weekend, we published an in-depth look at the congressional races in Orange County that could help Democrats seize control of the House. \u2022 And earlier in the campaign, we published a deep look at the corruption scandal that has engulfed Mr. Hunter. As day turns to night and the polls close, don\u2019t expect results right away. We may know who won the governor\u2019s race early \u2014 Mr. Newsom is comfortably ahead \u2014 but be prepared to wait for the outcome in the tight House races in Orange County and the Central Valley. California typically takes a long time to count votes, partly because residents can send mail-in votes through Election Day. Mark Baldassare, the president and chief executive of the Public Policy Institute of California, said the state had a history of being \u201cvery, very slow\u201d in counting ballots. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if we don\u2019t have definitive answers on election night,\u201d he said. (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) Happy Election Day, California. Here\u2019s a look at the candidates and ballot measures that some of the state\u2019s major newspapers are endorsing: \u2022 The Los Angeles Times endorses Ms. Feinstein for Senate and Mr. Newsom for governor, citing their experience and understanding of California\u2019s policy challenges. The paper supports Propositions 1, 2 and 10, which address housing issues by financing mortgages, funding supportive housing for the mentally ill and ending rent-control restrictions. See the full list of endorsements here. \u2022 The San Francisco Chronicle also recommends Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Newsom and supports Propositions 1 and 2. Its editorial board is against Proposition 10, saying the measure would \u201centrust another vast swath of housing policy to the very same officials \u2014 and probably yield similar results.\u201d See the full list of endorsements here. \u2022 The Sacramento Bee picks Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Newsom and supports Propositions 1, 2 and 10. It also recommends voting against Proposition 7, which would repeal Daylight Saving Time: \u201cCalifornia doesn\u2019t have time for this.\u201d See the full list of endorsements here. \u2022 The Mercury News also supports Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Newsom. Read its editorials and see the full list of endorsements \u2014 including regional measures and choices for Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties \u2014 here. \u2022 The Orange County Register recommends Mr. Cox for governor, saying the state\u2019s growing inequality and affordability should be addressed by Mr. Cox, a successful businessman. See its endorsements here. \u2022 The San Diego Union-Tribune endorses Ms. Feinstein, Mr. Newsom and Mr. Campa-Najjar, the 29-year-old Mexican-Palestinian-American Democrat who is challenging Mr. Hunter, who was indicted this year on fraud charges and campaign finance violations. See the full list of endorsements here. \u2022 The Fresno Bee recommends Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Newsom because of their grasp of policies that affect the Central Valley in particular. Ms. Feinstein \u201cunderstands Valley water issues and has worked across the aisle to steer more water to farmers,\u201d The Bee\u2019s editorial notes. See the full list of endorsements here. \u2022 The Tribune in San Luis Obispo supports Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Newsom, and like most other papers, advises against Proposition 6, which would repeal the state gas tax increase.

{"content": "Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia won the men\u2019s race in the New York City Marathon on Sunday, with a time of 2 hours 5 minutes 59 seconds, surging ahead of two other runners near the finish in Central Park. Mary Keitany, one of the fastest female marathon runners ever, won the women\u2019s race with a time of 2:22:48, her fourth victory in the event and the second-fastest time on this course. Desisa, 28, won his first New York City Marathon, defeating Shura Kitata, 22, also of Ethiopia, and Geoffrey Kamworor, 25, of Kenya, the defending champion and the prerace favorite. The runners ran the second-, third- and fourth-fastest times on the course. The race, with more than 50,000 participants winding 26.2 miles through all five boroughs, unfolded in buttery fall sunshine on a cool, breezy morning that brought out hundreds of thousands of spectators. Keitany, 36, of Kenya, made her sixth appearance in the New York City Marathon. She became only the third person to win the race four times. She came in second last year but won in 2014, 2015 and 2016. She beat Vivian Cheruiyot, 35, of Kenya, who ran 2:26:02 and Shalane Flanagan, 37, of the United States, who came in third with a time of 2:26:22, faster than the time she ran to win last year\u2019s race. In the wheelchair division, Daniel Romanchuk of the United States upset the defending men\u2019s champion, Marcel Hug of Switzerland, by one second in 1:36:21. Manuela Schar of Switzerland won the women\u2019s race, her second victory in the event. Keitany\u2019s time was 17 seconds off the women\u2019s course record, held by Margaret Okayo of Kenya with a time of 2:22:31 set in 2003. Keitany joined Grete Waitz as the only women to win the New York City Marathon four times. Waitz, a Norwegian, won the race nine times from 1978 to 1988. Keitany was back where she feels most comfortable in the marathon\u2019s women\u2019s race \u2014 far, far ahead of the rest of the pack. She ran alone as soon as she hit Manhattan and only accelerated her pace as she ground toward the finish, beating Cheruiyot by more than three minutes. The top women\u2019s finishers from Kenya were chased by an all-star roster of American distance runners, who worked together to challenge Keitany but could not match the pace she set, as it dropped by nearly a minute per mile in the second half of the race.

{"content": "LONDON \u2014 A British man who spent five months at sea is believed to be the first person to swim around the island of Great Britain, making his way back to land in Margate, a coastal town in southeastern England, on Sunday. The swimmer, Ross Edgley, 33, had not been ashore since June 1, when he set off on his 1,780-mile aquatic journey. Sunday morning, he was welcomed ashore by loud, enthusiastic cheers. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t feel real,\u201d Mr. Edgley told the BBC. For more than 150 days, Mr. Edgley swam six to 12 hours a day. He spent the rest of his time eating and sleeping on his support boat, from where he documented his quest in episodes streamed online. Mr. Edgley, the author of a fitness guide, created the #GreatBritishSwim hashtag for his feat, and regularly posted on Instagram to his 268,000 followers. His audience saw his struggles with strong tides, soreness, cold water, and jellyfish. Almost two weeks after he entered the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest staged sea swim, Mr. Edgley posted an unflattering photograph of the impact the swim was having on his body \u2014 specifically his heavily bruised, swollen feet, which looked as flat as fins. \u201cThe harsh reality of spending hours, days & months at sea swimming,\u201d he captioned the Sept. 2 photograph. Swimming day in and day out in saltwater also turned his tongue dry and sore, making it hard for him to eat, swallow or talk. The solution? Coconut oil and yogurt, which helped him to overcome the soreness and keep going. Mr. Edgley said that even though he had not enjoyed every single moment of the swim, discipline kept him going. \u201cThere are times when there are milky ways, or seals \u2014 that it is amazing; it\u2019s a real privilege,\u201d he said. \u201cBut other times it\u2019s less about enjoyment, and more just about discipline.\u201d In 2013, Sean Conway became the first man to swim the length of Britain when he swam from Land\u2019s End in western Cornwall to John O\u2019Groats in northern Scotland, according to the BBC. No one other than Mr. Edgley is known to have completed a circumnavigation of Britain. Why he did it is not entirely clear. But Mr. Edgley is no stranger to extreme tasks; this was the third exercise involving mental and physical strength that he has completed this year. In January, he accomplished the world\u2019s longest rope climb in less than 24 hours by repeatedly pulling himself up and down a 10-meter rope until he had climbed 8,848 meters, or 29,029 feet \u2014 the height of Mount Everest. In June, he attempted to swim almost 25 miles from Martinique to St. Lucia while tied to a tree. Because of strong currents, he didn\u2019t make it to the shore, he said, which prompted him to take on an even more demanding aquatic challenge. \u201cThe adventurer in me had unfinished business,\u201d he said after the Caribbean exercise. After he returned to Britain, he asked the Royal Marines if he could be allowed to swim for 48 hours straight, \u201cjust to see what I\u2019ve got in the locker,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the marines mentioned the idea of swimming around the entirety of Britain \u2014 something that\u2019s never been done before, And I thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d What\u2019s next after five months of swimming? Mr. Edgley said that his plans involved something much more practical. \u201cI\u2019ve got to learn to walk again,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/world/europe/great-britain-swim-ross-edgley.html", "date": "2018-11-04 00:00:00", "author": "By Iliana Magra", "description": "Ross Edgley, 33, started his swim in June and endured rough tides, cold water, sore feet and jellyfish to complete his circumnavigation feat on Sunday.", "title": "First Known Swimmer to Circumnavigate Britain Spent 5 Months at Sea"},
{"content": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 The husband of a Pakistani Christian woman acquitted after spending eight years on death row on blasphemy charges has appealed to President Trump for refuge, citing danger to the family\u2019s lives. Ashiq Masih, the husband of Asia Bibi, whose case has outraged Christians worldwide and been a source of division within Pakistan, also appealed to Britain and Canada for assistance. The appeal came as the police said they had arrested more than 150 people on charges of arson, vandalism and violence during the protests that erupted after Ms. Bibi\u2019s acquittal. A senior police officer, Nayab Haider, said on Sunday that officers were using video to identify others involved in committing assaults, torching property and vehicles, and blocking highways, The Associated Press said. The Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labaik blocked major roads in Pakistan\u2019s biggest cities for three days, calling for the killing of the Supreme Court judges who acquitted Ms. Bibi on Wednesday, and terming Prime Minister Imran Khan and the country\u2019s army chief enemies of Islam. Tehreek-e-Labaik called off the protests late Friday after striking a deal with the government that could see the authorities moving to put Ms. Bibi on an \u201cexit control list\u201d barring her from leaving the country and opening a review of the verdict. \u201cI am requesting the president of the United States, Donald Trump, to help us exit from Pakistan,\u201d Mr. Masih said in a video recorded by the British Pakistani Christian Association and seen by Reuters. \u201cI also request the prime minister of the United Kingdom to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cI also request the prime minister of Canada.\u201d He also requested help on behalf of his brother Joseph Nadeem, who has assisted with Ms. Bibi\u2019s case. The United States Embassy and the high commissions of Britain and Canada in Islamabad did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the video. On Saturday, Ms. Bibi\u2019s lawyer, Saiful Mulook, told Reuters that he had left Pakistan, fearing for his life and the safety of his family. Ms. Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 after being accused of making derogatory remarks about Islam when neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim. She has denied having committed any offense. Her case caught the attention of Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab Province. He was assassinated by his bodyguard in 2011, after waging a public campaign to save Ms. Bibi\u2019s life and to change the blasphemy laws \u2014 a move that angered his bodyguard. Tehreek-e-Labaik was founded out of a movement to support Mr. Taseer\u2019s assassin, who was hanged in 2016. The federal minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, was also killed after calling for Ms. Bibi\u2019s release. Ms. Bibi\u2019s location is unknown, but Tehreek-e-Labaik has warned the authorities not to take her out of the country. \u201cThere will be a war if they send Asia out of country,\u201d the party\u2019s leader, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, said after the deal with the government was reached. Islamist parties have characterized Ms. Bibi\u2019s release as Pakistan\u2019s government caving into Western demands.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/world/asia/pakistan-asia-bibi-asylum.html", "date": "2018-11-04 00:00:00", "author": "By Reuters", "description": "The husband of Asia Bibi, who spent eight years on death row, appealed to Britain, Canada and the United States, saying their lives were in danger.", "title": "Husband of Freed Pakistani Christian Woman Pleads for Asylum"},
{"content": "In online videos, he spewed misogynistic and racist vitriol \u2014 and railed against all the women who had turned him down. In real life, records show, he had a history of harassing women and was accused of touching women\u2019s buttocks without their consent. And on Friday, the authorities said, he shot two women to death and injured five other people at a Florida yoga studio before killing himself. The gunman, Scott P. Beierle, 40, posed as a customer at the studio in Tallahassee, Fla., and then opened fire without warning, the police said. The authorities were investigating to determine Mr. Beierle\u2019s connection to the yoga studio and the victims. Officials identified the victims who were killed as Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 61, a faculty member at Florida State University, and Maura Binkley, 21, a student there. Four women and one man suffered non-life-threatening injuries. \u201cThere are no words to express the shock and grief we feel,\u201d John Thrasher, the president of Florida State, said on Twitter on Saturday. He added, \u201cTo lose one of our students and one of our faculty members in this tragic and violent way is just devastating to the FSU family.\u201d Mr. Beierle, who the authorities said had prior military service, lived in Deltona, Fla., and had been staying at a hotel while visiting Tallahassee, the police said. He was a graduate of Florida State, where he had been arrested at least twice, once on charges of battery against women, according to records and the police. He also had a history of expressing misogynistic and racist views. In a series of videos posted over a three-day period in August 2014, he ranted against women and minorities, the police and the Army \u2014 anyone and everyone who he believed had wronged him. BuzzFeed News first reported on the videos. In the videos, Mr. Beierle pontificated from a dimly lit bedroom, with an unmade bed and a pile of cardboard boxes in the background. He lamented his inability to connect with other people \u2014 from Army comrades who he said would not travel with him while stationed in Europe to women who refused to go out with him. He identified with \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d and told personal stories of rejection, naming multiple girls who he said had wronged him. \u201cMade one date, didn\u2019t show up,\u201d he said of one woman. \u201cMade another date, didn\u2019t show up. Kept making excuses. Ah, I could\u2019ve ripped her head off.\u201d He expressed sympathy with Elliot O. Rodger, who killed six people in Isla Vista, Calif., three months before Mr. Beierle recorded the videos. Mr. Rodger had expressed his disgust at women online and urged \u201cincels\u201d \u2014 shorthand for involuntary celibates \u2014 to fight back. In the videos, Mr. Beierle also railed against interracial dating, and used racist and disparaging language when talking about black people. He also referred to trouble with the Army after an incident in Amsterdam in which he said four women complained about his behavior. \u201cI got too rowdy for their sensibilities,\u201d he said. Records show that Mr. Beierle moved from Vestal, N.Y., near Binghamton, to Tallahassee in 2011. In December 2012, Mr. Beierle was charged with battery after a woman accused him of grabbing her buttocks at a dining hall on Florida State\u2019s campus in Tallahassee. The charges were dismissed in May 2013, court records show. In 2014, Mr. Beierle was charged with trespassing at a dining hall on campus and was given pretrial intervention, though it was unclear exactly what that entailed or how the case was resolved. Mr. Beierle was again charged with battery in June 2016, but the charge was dismissed in 2017, records show. In that case, Tallahassee police records show, Mr. Beierle was arrested after he approached a woman sunbathing at a pool and complimented her on her figure. He offered to put sunscreen on her buttocks, but she told him no and he groped her without her permission, according to the police report. On Friday, Mr. Beierle entered Hot Yoga Tallahassee with a handgun, the police said. When he began shooting, some people inside fought back, preventing a greater tragedy, Michael DeLeo, the chief of the Tallahassee Police Department, said in a statement on Saturday. Ms. Binkley, a senior at Florida State, was set to graduate in May, said Azalee Vereen, her aunt. Ms. Binkley studied journalism and German, and was preparing for life after college by applying for programs like Fulbright and Teach for America. Ms. Binkley, who grew up in a northern suburb of Atlanta, was \u201cvery smart, very beautiful and just very giving,\u201d Ms. Vereen said. Dr. Van Vessem was responsible for coordinating the third- and fourth-year clerkship rotations in internal medicine at the Tallahassee campus of Florida State, according to a profile on the university\u2019s website. \u201cShe was an outstanding physician with a passion for access to health care,\u201d said Pam Irwin, the executive director of Capital Medical Society, a Tallahassee-based professional organization for doctors, of which Dr. Van Vessem was a member. \u201cWithout being aware, she was a mentor. She represented how to serve others with wisdom, ethics, compassion and collaboration.\u201d Myra Hurt, a medical professor and senior associate dean at Florida State, called Dr. Van Vessem \u201ca formidable woman.\u201d \u201cI knew going into a meeting with her that I had to be ready,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if we didn\u2019t agree on something, you knew she was operating from a position of protecting her patients.

About halfway through \u201cNetwork,\u201d Sidney Lumet\u2019s Oscar-winning 1976 satire that feels rumblingly prescient now, there\u2019s a scene of exquisitely performative rage.

Bryan Cranston stars as Howard Beale in Lee Hall\u2019s stage adaptation of Paddy Chayefsky\u2019s screenplay, directed by Ivo van Hove and opening on Dec. 6. When the production had its premiere last fall at the National Theater in London, Ben Brantley, in The New York Times, called it \u201cconvulsive,\u201d and Mr. Cranston \u201cthe perfect stark raving center for this meticulously calibrated mayhem.\u201d Joining the New York cast as Diana Christensen, the cold-as-ice executive Faye Dunaway played onscreen, is Tatiana Maslany (\u201cOrphan Black\u201d).

It\u2019s something Jared\u2019s mother can\u2019t abide, regardless of what her husband believes.

It is hard to know how seriously to take Mahan Esfahani, the self-styled harpsichordist provocateur who has made a point of publicly rebuking his peers in the small world of early keyboard performance. But his interpretations of standard repertoire have been strongly praised \u2014 The New Yorker described his efforts as \u201cexuberant, anti-sentimental, bracing \u2014 and his commitment to growing the repertoire of new works for his very old instrument is persuasive.

WILLIAM ROBIN Nov. 6 and 7; bowerypresents.com. The band name boygenius was conceived of with tongue firmly in cheek: When singer-songwriters Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus decided to turn a national tour together into a six-song EP, they thought of the people who were, for once, not included. \u201cWe were just talking about boys and men we know who\u2019ve been told that they are geniuses since they could hear, basically,\u201d Dacus told The Times, \u201cand what type of creative work comes out of that upbringing.\u201d Their self-titled EP was recently released on Matador, just ahead of their 19-show tour which includes a two-day run at Brooklyn Steel. The women will perform separate sets, with some songs together. All three share a talent for making heartfelt, earnest songs that still sound fresh; beyond that, they each have distinctive styles.  Dacus veers toward folk and rock; Bridgers, grungy pop; and Baker, melancholy tunes with unconventional arrangements. Luckily for fans, instead of fighting the fact that they are grouped together because they\u2019re all women, they chose to lean into it. The result is even more thoughtful and cathartic pop music that sounds new thanks to the original voices singing it. NATALIE WEINER  Through March 3, 2019; thejewishmuseum.org.

{"content": "This spring, a British lord with deep ties to the governing Conservative Party and a reputation as a do-gooder environmentalist arrived in Washington on an unlikely mission: to save the business empire of Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia\u2019s most infamous oligarchs. Mr. Deripaska was in deep trouble. In April, the Trump administration had announced sanctions on oligarchs close to President Vladimir V. Putin, and on their companies, as punishment for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and for other hostile acts. A billionaire who controls the world\u2019s second-largest aluminum company, Mr. Deripaska faced possible ruin. Portrayed as little more than a thug by his critics and suspected by United States officials of having ties to Russian organized crime, Mr. Deripaska, 50, has spent two decades trying to buy respect in the West. London welcomed him; Washington still mostly has not. Successive administrations have limited his ability to travel to the United States. Even Mr. Putin was unable to resolve the situation when he interceded personally with Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama on Mr. Deripaska\u2019s behalf. But with so much on the line this time, Mr. Deripaska\u2019s allies are now fighting back aggressively, mobilizing a vast influence machine on both sides of the Atlantic in an all-out effort to undo the sanctions against his companies before they take full effect. The campaign to help Mr. Deripaska is playing out against an especially sensitive political backdrop. Any step by the administration that is seen as favorable to a powerful Russian is sure to draw scrutiny at a time when the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is continuing his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Moreover, Mr. Deripaska has been a subsidiary character in that inquiry, not as a target but because he at one point employed Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, as an adviser. Mr. Manafort was convicted on one set of fraud charges and pleaded guilty to other charges in cases brought by Mr. Mueller, and is now cooperating with the prosecution. But the current lobbying effort on behalf of Mr. Deripaska\u2019s companies still appears to have made substantial headway. In recent months, Mr. Deripaska\u2019s firms have notched initial victories by winning multiple postponements from the Treasury Department of the sanctions on the oligarch\u2019s holding company, EN+, and the giant aluminum company it controls, Rusal. Now, with the administration closing in on its latest self-imposed deadline to make a final decision by Dec. 12, there are signs that Mr. Deripaska\u2019s companies could escape the sanctions entirely. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has signaled that he is open to a plan under which Mr. Deripaska would reduce his stake in his companies in return for the sanctions being lifted. But sidestepping the business sanctions is not Mr. Deripaska\u2019s only goal. His team is preparing an audacious and previously unreported campaign to remove the personal sanctions on him, too. Removing the personal sanctions would eliminate substantial barriers to his doing business in the United States and around the world, and could be a requirement for him to get his hands on the money \u2014 potentially billions of dollars \u2014 resulting from any sale of part of his stake in the companies. \u201cOleg Deripaska understands better than most Russian oligarchs how money buys influence in Washington,\u201d said Michael R. Carpenter, a former National Security Council official during the Obama administration who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s now using that knowledge to try to save his skin.\u201d The elaborate influence operation highlights one of the fastest-growing elements of the lobbying business: helping deep-pocketed foreign interests massage the sanctions, tariffs and other tools deployed by Mr. Trump against foreign governments, individuals and industries. The British emissary for Mr. Deripaska\u2019s companies, Lord Barker of Battle, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of David Cameron, the former prime minister of Britain, was appointed last year as chairman of EN+. Also involved are lobbyists, law firms, public relations experts, a former United States senator and a former Trump campaign official with ties to the Treasury Department and the White House. Even ambassadors to Washington from a number of countries have been approached to write letters opposing the sanctions. The Treasury Department\u2019s decision carries significant economic implications, given Rusal\u2019s vital place in supplying aluminum around the world. Lord Barker and the team trying to fight off the sanctions say that enacting them against EN+ and Rusal would create turmoil in global metals markets, damage American manufacturers and potentially play into China\u2019s hands. Their proposal, the \u201cBarker Plan,\u201d would see Mr. Deripaska sell down his ownership stake in EN+, his holding company, to below 50 percent and step away from management of EN+ and Rusal. But this would hinge on being able to trust and verify that a Russian oligarch who has spent decades building up a global empire \u2014 amid persistent accusations that he is more a Kremlin loyalist than an independent tycoon \u2014 is truly giving up control. Mr. Deripaska\u2019s track record on two continents offers a case study in how the world\u2019s wealthiest people can mount sophisticated campaigns to fight for their interests at the highest levels, often in ways that are not fully visible and that are reliant on the willingness of insiders to provide access. He has sought to rebrand himself as a progressive and pro-Western business executive and philanthropist. Mr. Manafort is among an army of lobbyists, lawyers and consultants whom Mr. Deripaska has employed around the world to help him build and protect his empire, or to try to persuade the United States to grant him visas on a regular basis. Mr. Deripaska has courted powerful political figures in Britain, played host to lavish parties in Davos, Switzerland, and once hired a former Republican presidential nominee, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, to lobby for him. \u201cThere is already a perception \u2014 certainly abroad, but even in Washington \u2014 that Washington is a city where you buy influence rather than having to make arguments and do the right thing,\u201d said Peter Harrell, who worked on sanctions issues in the State Department during the Obama administration. \u201cThat perception would be crystallized by a sanctioned company being able to lobby its way off the list,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Deripaska faces enormous losses, it would send a message of sanctions success, but if Deripaska is able to get off with a slap on the wrist, that would be a massive blow to the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions.\u201d Mr. Deripaska\u2019s troubled reputation derives in large part from what was also his greatest triumph: his victory over rivals and partners during the 1990s, when well-connected Russians were competing to win control of state assets after the collapse of the Soviet Union. That competition, the so-called aluminum wars, was a corpse-filled struggle for control of Siberian smelters and other state-owned Soviet assets that was so violent that even some of Russia\u2019s toughest tycoons gave it a wide berth. \u201cThere were so many murders that I refused to go into this business,\u201d recalled Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a billionaire former oil magnate who now lives in self-exile in London and who during the 1990s forbade his associates from pursuing a smelter deal. \u201cI told them: \u2018Don\u2019t go out there. I need you to stay alive.\u2019\u201d Mr. Deripaska, who once studied physics at Moscow State University, became a billionaire. But he was left with a ruthless image, especially as claims later emerged in legal battles in London and the United States that he engaged in theft, intimidation, bribery and even murder, notably of a Russian banker in 1995. (None of the accusations have been substantiated.) One complaint filed in Delaware cast Mr. Deripaska as a member of a criminal gang that seized control of an iron-ore mining complex in the Ural Mountains in the late 1990s. The previous manager claimed that at a meeting attended by Mr. Deripaska, a mafia leader and five armed thugs, he was told to transfer a majority share or \u201cthis is the last time you will leave here alive.\u201d The case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and Mr. Deripaska\u2019s lawyers have routinely responded to lawsuits with counterclaims that his accusers were themselves crooks and lacked credibility. (A London arbitration tribunal did order him to pay $95 million in 2017 for knowingly lying to the tribunal while finding he had \u201cacted oppressively\u201d to his former partner in a Moscow property venture.) His dominance of the Russian metals markets gave him the resources to look abroad. By 2000, he commenced a decade of overseas expansion, buying a smelter in Montenegro, an aluminum factory in Ireland and bauxite mines in Africa. Then he turned his eyes to London. Mr. Deripaska was now a global figure, and London was becoming the money-soaked fulcrum for a glitzy, international business and the social elite. He bought a six-story mansion on Belgrave Square, as well as a country house in Surrey. He married Polina Yumasheva, a British-educated daughter of the chief of staff of Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia\u2019s former president. (The couple has since divorced.) Ensconced in society, Mr. Deripaska befriended Nathaniel Rothschild, a British-born financier whose father is a British peer, and through him met the Conservative Party politician George Osborne, a future chancellor of the Exchequer, as well as Lord Peter Mandelson, a leading figure in the Labour Party. Mr. Deripaska reveled among global movers and shakers, and he remains a regular figure at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He has always argued that these relationships were simply friendships, but soon questions would arise about whether he was really trying to buy influence. The British news media revealed that the oligarch had flown Mr. Rothschild and Lord Mandelson on his private jet in 2005 for a jaunt in Siberia. At the time, Lord Mandelson was the European Union\u2019s trade commissioner, and in this role, he oversaw a cut in tariffs on aluminum imports from Russia requested by Poland and other members of the bloc. It was a boon to Rusal. (The European Commission has denied that Mr. Mandelson personally intervened in the matter.) Mr. Rothschild sued a British newspaper for libel for suggesting that the trip was anything more than an act of friendship, but the judge ruled against him. In the summer of 2008, Mr. Deripaska again played host, this time on his yacht, Queen K, off the Greek island of Corfu. Onboard were Mr. Osborne, Lord Mandelson and Andrew Feldman, a Conservative Party fund-raiser. The yacht meeting caused a media and political storm in Britain, after claims in a letter to The Times of London by Mr. Rothschild, who was also in Corfu, that Mr. Osborne had sought a contribution from Mr. Deripaska to the Conservative Party. Mr. Osborne denied requesting what would have been an illegal donation. \u201cDeripaska does not hang around with people like this for social reasons,\u201d said Mark Hollingsworth, an author of \u201cLondongrad,\u201d a book about Russian oligarchs in the British capital. \u201cHe is not mesmerized by the historical legacy of the British elite. He is not really interested in high society and parties. It is much more hard-nosed commercial calculation: \u2018Who are the big names, who has the power and who can help me?\u2019\u201d And London unquestionably had lawyers, bankers, consultants and former politicians willing to earn generous fees by working in the service of Russian oligarchs with unseemly pasts. \u201cTo outsiders, it seems extraordinary that reputable banks and people would ever get involved,\u201d said Tom Keatinge, a former banker with J. P. Morgan who now directs the Center for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a British research organization. \u201cBut when there are big fees on the table, people\u2019s point of view is not the same.\u201d Mr. Deripaska also had his eyes on the United States, where he had acquired property and had business links with Alcoa, the world\u2019s sixth-largest aluminum producer. But in Washington, the reception was much chillier. The State Department, worried that he had connections to Russian organized crime, has restricted his travel to the United States for years, mostly forcing him to rely on occasional American visas or a Russian diplomatic passport. Despite the barriers, he has managed visits to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Hawaii, people familiar with his travel said. Annoyed, and cognizant of the potential effect on his business, Mr. Deripaska has pursued winning easier and more regular access to the United States with near-obsessive zeal. One moment of success came in 2005, when he was given a multiple-entry American visa, after hiring Mr. Dole, the former presidential nominee who had gone into lobbying. Mr. Dole\u2019s firm, Alston & Bird, reported receiving an upfront lobbying fee of $300,000 from Mr. Deripaska, followed by at least $270,000 in additional payments over the next few years, according to congressional lobbying reports. In the end, the victory was short-lived: The visa was revoked not long after being granted at the request of the F.B.I., a person briefed on the process said. Around the time his visa was being revoked, Mr. Deripaska hired Mr. Manafort and signed his firm to a $10 million-a-year contract in 2006 to advise him. One of Mr. Manafort\u2019s associates lobbied President George W. Bush\u2019s administration to reconsider the visa issue, but the efforts went nowhere, according to David Merkel, who worked on Russia-related issues in Mr. Bush\u2019s White House and State Department. \u201cDeripaska has spent years trying to mainstream himself into the political and financial elite,\u201d Mr. Merkel said. Mr. Manafort and his business partner at the time, Rick Davis, arranged a meeting in 2006 on the sidelines of the Davos forum between Mr. Deripaska and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who was preparing a campaign for president. There is no evidence anything came of the meeting, though it became a liability for Mr. McCain\u2019s campaign. Mr. Deripaska eventually fired Mr. Manafort and his partner. He later sued them after a dispute over a telecommunications deal they had pursued together. In the months before the election of Barack Obama in 2008, Mr. Deripaska turned to a lobbyist with Democratic connections, Adam Waldman, who served in the Justice Department under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Waldman earned $40,000 a month to help the oligarch with visa issues, as well as with business matters like aluminum trade talks and an unsuccessful bid to buy European operations from General Motors. Mr. Waldman helped him arrange various trips, including to attend a Wall Street Journal-sponsored summit meeting of top business executives in Washington. He also later arranged meetings between Mr. Deripaska and George Soros, the wealthy Democratic donor, to discuss anticorruption efforts in the mining industry in Guinea, where Rusal is a major player, according to people familiar with the meetings. Hoping to show that he could be useful to the United States, Mr. Deripaska used his connections and resources at one point in a thwarted effort to help Washington win the release of a hostage in Iran. In the weeks before the 2016 election, Mr. Deripaska rebuffed an approach from the F.B.I., which was seeking his help in the early stages of the inquiry into Russian meddling. \u201cHe didn\u2019t need introductions to other captains of industry or philanthropists. They lined up to meet with him,\u201d Mr. Waldman said. \u201cOnly elements of the U.S. government had a problem with him \u2014 that they would insinuate in leaks and blocks, but never state outright.\u201d Mr. Deripaska\u2019s long struggle to travel more freely to the United States had cost him time, money and pride. But a far bigger problem throughout was keeping his business empire afloat. Saddled with debt, Mr. Deripaska raised money to stave off creditors in January 2010 by listing Rusal, his aluminum company, on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. He appointed his old friend from London, Mr. Rothschild, to his international advisory board. But that only forestalled the pressure to repay a corporate loan of $942 million from VTB, a Russian bank considered close to Mr. Putin and under sanction by the United States. To do this, Mr. Deripaska decided to put a small portion of his 96 percent stake in EN+, which controlled Rusal, on the market with a listing on the London exchange in November 2017. Yet prospective investors were initially lukewarm. Mr. Deripaska was trailed by accusations of wrecking the environment and taking advantage of his partners. The prospectus listed 37 pages of fine print on \u201crisk factors.\u201d Once again, Mr. Deripaska turned to the city\u2019s influence industry. EN+ hired a well-connected London public relations company, run by Roland Rudd, whose sister, Amber Rudd, was Britain\u2019s home secretary at the time. Mr. Deripaska reached out to a consultancy owned by Lord Mandelson. And he hired major international banks to organize the offering. Most important, EN+ found a new chairman, only weeks before the stock offering: Lord Barker, a former energy minister responsible for climate change policy. Unlike Mr. Deripaska, Lord Barker had a largely spotless reputation. His only minor brushes with scandal came in 2006, when he left his wife to live with a male interior decorator, and in 2012, while serving as energy minister, when he made the tabloids for using a microwave at Parliament to warm a cushion for his pet dachshund, Otto. Lord Barker\u2019s appointment, the company declared, was proof of its \u201ccommitment to the best standard of corporate governance.\u201d His allies say his efforts since then have been focused on what is best for the company \u2014 its employees and all of its shareholders \u2014 rather than on Mr. Deripaska\u2019s personal benefit. Others saw Lord Barker\u2019s appointment as chairman of EN+ as proof of a phenomenon known as \u201cLords on Boards,\u201d a long line of eminent Britons willing to lend their names and connections to Russia\u2019s scandal-singed elite. Before entering politics in the early 2000s, Lord Barker had worked in Moscow as the head of investor relations for Sibneft, a Russian oil company connected to two Russian oligarchs, Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, a onetime business partner of Mr. Deripaska\u2019s. Lord Barker\u2019s job was to persuade often skeptical investors and financial journalists that Sibneft had shaken off its shady past in rigged privatization deals and broken with the habits of its oligarch founders. Now, Lord Barker assumed the chairmanship of EN+ and the London listing was a success. Mr. Deripaska, with his family, took around $1.5 billion from the stock sale and was able to repay VTB. Then in April came the sanctions announcement from Washington, which Mr. Deripaska described in a statement as \u201cgroundless, ridiculous and absurd.\u201d The world\u2019s aluminum market shook, as shares of EN+ went into a nosedive on the London exchange, where the company quickly lost more than half of its value. The sanctions, which punish third parties that do business with designated companies and individuals, led to a mass exodus of his advisers. In London, Mr. Rudd\u2019s public relations company bailed, as did the consultancy business run by Lord Mandelson. Citigroup and Credit Suisse, which EN+ named in January as \u201cjoint corporate brokers\u201d and which earlier had worked on the company\u2019s public offering along with other banks, swiftly severed relations. In Washington, Mr. Waldman terminated his representation of Mr. Deripaska and Rusal. The prospect that it would soon become illegal under United States law to do business with the world\u2019s biggest aluminum producer outside of China made it dangerous to sign long-term contracts with any entity connected to Mr. Deripaska. Manufacturers feared grave disruptions in their supplies. Hanging on as chairman of the board, however, was Lord Barker. Rather than being a figurehead chairman, he was suddenly faced with having to save a company whose structures he had only just become acquainted with. Friends say Lord Barker is not in it for the money but for an opportunity to promote renewable energy, of which Mr. Deripaska has vast amounts thanks to his hydroelectric plants in Siberia and his investments in solar power. \u201cHe would not compromise his beliefs for money,\u201d said Peter Brown, a British businessman and friend of Lord Barker\u2019s who once managed the Beatles. In recent months, Lord Barker has lobbied Ireland\u2019s business minister to press the Treasury Department to relent on sanctions. He has also made trips to Moscow and to Cyprus, where he presided over the annual general meeting of EN+. Most important, Lord Barker began hiring lobbyists and lawyers in Washington to promote the Barker Plan. The core of that plan is the still-to-be-proved proposition that Lord Barker and his allies are not merely puppets, and that Mr. Deripaska is really willing to sell down his stake and step away from his empire. The legal and lobbying teams for Mr. Deripaska\u2019s companies have proposed various measures to reassure the United States government that he would truly do so \u2014 and not immediately benefit from an expected rebound in value that would come from lifting the corporate sanctions. He and several allies have resigned from top positions at EN+ and Rusal. The Barker Plan also calls for the creation of an escrow account into which the proceeds from Mr. Deripaska\u2019s stock sales would be deposited. He would be barred from accessing the money until he met certain conditions, including being removed from the personal sanctions list. Lord Barker \u201cwants to save Deripaska by getting rid of Deripaska,\u201d said David Ruffley, a former British legislator and an old friend of Lord Barker\u2019s. In Washington, Lord Barker turned to Mercury Public Affairs. Only a few weeks after the sanctions were announced, Bryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign and transition aide who is now a Mercury lobbyist, contacted top officials at the Treasury and State Departments and at the White House. At that point, Mercury was in the final stages of signing a $108,500-a-month contract to represent the board of directors of EN+. Mercury registered with the Justice Department as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d working on behalf of \u201cLord Gregory Barker of Battle,\u201d not for Mr. Deripaska or his companies, which might have been prohibited under the sanctions. Since then, according to lobbying filings, Mr. Lanza has been busy texting, emailing, calling and sometimes meeting with influential White House appointees, including Justin Clark, the director of the Office of Public Liaison, and Mercedes Schlapp, the director of strategic communications. At the State and Treasury Departments, Mr. Lanza and his associates at Mercury corresponded with or met with officials involved in sanctions policy, such as David Meale, the acting deputy assistant secretary of state overseeing sanctions, and Seth Bridge, a top Treasury sanctions policy adviser. Mr. Lanza shared talking points with some administration officials about how Mr. Trump could claim a victory if the sanctions forced Mr. Deripaska to relinquish control of his companies, but allowed the companies \u2014 which are hugely important to the global aluminum market \u2014 to stay in business, according to people familiar with the effort. Coincidentally or not, Mr. Mnuchin made statements that sounded similar themes, signaling that the United States might be open to a deal that would spare Mr. Deripaska\u2019s companies from the sanctions. Speaking to reporters at the White House in late July, Mr. Mnuchin said the aim of sanctions was to \u201cchange the behavior of the oligarch,\u201d not to punish his aluminum business. That line of argument has now been seized on by both Lord Barker and Mr. Deripaska as they await announcement of the administration\u2019s decision. Lord Barker\u2019s office issued a statement saying he was \u201cincreasingly optimistic\u201d that a deal would be struck. Lord Barker declined repeated requests to be interviewed. On Saturday, an associate of Mr. Deripaska relayed an offer to arrange an interview with the oligarch if The New York Times refrained from publishing this story until after Treasury decides on the sanctions. The Times declined the offer. In a separate statement issued through Rusal\u2019s press office, which was similar in wording to Lord Barker\u2019s statement, Mr. Deripaska said, \u201cTo protect the dedicated employees of EN+ and Rusal, and to preserve the rights of all global stakeholders of both companies, I have chosen to relinquish any remaining management or control of both EN+ and Rusal.\u201d A Treasury spokesman disputed any suggestion that Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s approach to sanctions has been shaped by Mercury\u2019s efforts, or that the department has changed its position. If nothing else, the lobbying effort is notable for its scale. Lord Barker\u2019s team and Mr. Deripaska\u2019s companies have also turned to a trio of high-powered law firms to make their case to Treasury. Latham & Watkins is representing Lord Barker; Dentons is handling negotiations for Rusal; and Steptoe & Johnson is working for EN+, according to people familiar with the effort. Another Mercury lobbyist, the former Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, led an effort to rally foreign ambassadors in Washington against sanctions, working to persuade them that hurting Mr. Deripaska\u2019s business will hurt manufacturing in their own countries by disrupting the supply of aluminum. While awaiting the Trump administration\u2019s decision, Mr. Deripaska has lowered his public profile since announcing his resignation from the EN+ board in May. His wealth on paper has fallen by $4 billion since April because of the sharp fall in the company\u2019s stock price. He and his family now control a 77 percent stake in EN+ and, as yet, have not sold any their shares. No matter what happens, K Street is profiting. In fact, Mr. Deripaska\u2019s team has approached still more lawyers and public relations consultants in recent weeks about joining an effort to try to remove the personal sanctions against him, too, describing it as a long-term campaign.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/world/europe/oleg-deripaska-russia-oligarch-sanctions.html", "date": "2018-11-04 00:00:00", "author": "By Andrew Higgins and Kenneth P.

{"content": "Democrats appear poised to win the House popular vote on Tuesday by a wide margin, with national polls showing sustained disapproval of President Trump \u2014 and yet the fate of the chamber is not a foregone conclusion.  On the day before the midterm elections, two vastly different outcomes remain easy to imagine. There could be a Democratic blowout that decisively ends Republicans\u2019 control of the House and even endangers their Senate majority. Or there could be a district-by-district battle for House control that lasts late on election night and perhaps for weeks after.  The first would be interpreted as a repudiation of Donald J. Trump, the second as another example of his political resilience. But the difference turns on just a few percentage points across dozens of House districts that remain exceptionally close, according to New York Times Upshot/Siena College surveys conducted over the last few weeks.  After more than 10,000 interviews, the result, in the aggregate, is that Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied in the 30 districts rated as tossups by the Cook Political Report, with Democrats leading by around half a percentage point. Democrats need to win only a handful of these tossup districts \u2014 perhaps as few as six \u2014 to gain the net 23 seats needed to take control, which is why they\u2019re considered favorites. But Democrats haven\u2019t put them away. Instead, those races remain startlingly close. Each of the final 28 poll results in the tossup districts was within the margin of error, and 20 of the 28 were within two percentage points, a margin that pales in comparison with the typical measurement error in a poll.  With so many close contests, even modest late shifts among undecided voters or a slightly unexpected turnout could yield significantly different results, with very different consequences for the government and the future of the Trump presidency. Over all, the polls comport with the growing consensus among operatives from both parties that Democrats are poised to gain around 35 seats in the House. If the Times/Siena polls were exactly right (they will not be), Democrats would gain 32 seats, assuming the two parties held the seats that were not polled.  All of the conditions remain in place for a so-called wave election, like those that last flipped control of the House in 1994, 2006 and 2010. Democrats hold a commanding lead on the generic congressional ballot (which asks voters whether they intend to vote for Democrats or Republicans for Congress), including an eight-point lead in an ABC/Washington Post poll in Sunday.  But the Republicans have considerable structural advantages in the House that the president\u2019s party didn\u2019t have to the same extent in previous wave elections. They are generally defending districts that voted for the president, a result of partisan gerrymandering and the tendency for Democrats to post lopsided and inefficient victories in urban areas. The Republican geographic advantage is even more significant in the Senate, where Republicans are all but assured to retain control if they win just three of seven competitive seats where Mr. Trump won by at least nine points in 2016. The Democrats are poised to defy those structural disadvantages in the House because they\u2019ve put so many Republican-leaning districts into play with a deep and exceptionally well-funded class of candidates.  But Republicans can hope that partisan polarization is just enough to keep even strong Democrats from going over the top. The president has emphasized immigration and other hot-button issues down the final stretch, perhaps in an intentional effort to divide the electorate along the lines of the 2016 election. If Republicans succeed in polarizing the electorate, they could take advantage of their underlying geographic advantages and hold down their losses in the House and gain seats in the Senate.  Alone, a more polarized electorate wouldn\u2019t be enough for Republicans to hold the House. There are too many districts that voted for Hillary Clinton. To retain House control, Republicans would probably need some good luck on top of a more polarized map, or perhaps a broader 2016-like polling error. But a narrow Democratic majority might take weeks to become clear as California and Washington count late mail ballots. The emphasis on a wide range of possible outcomes isn\u2019t just a matter of hedging by pollsters and analysts after the shock of 2016, when Mr. Trump beat long odds. The uncertainty reflects the sparse data available and the unusually large number of competitive contests. In dozens of key districts, no more than a few polls have been done, making it hard to be confident whether (and where) Democratic or Republican candidates might hold a lead. Final House polls have historically been less accurate than polls of statewide contests and presidential races. On average, House polls differ from final election results by around eight percentage points. These polls tend to have relatively small sample sizes, increasing the margin of error, and voters tend to be less familiar with House candidates, meaning more \u201cundecideds\u201d until late in the race. Democrats hope that these common sources of polling error might break their way this time.  Turnout is always uncertain, but it is more variable in lower-turnout elections, like a midterm, when even modest shifts in enthusiasm can transform the electorate. It is a particularly challenging question this year, in part because the turnout in recent midterm elections has been so low and so Republican.  This year\u2019s early vote tallies already make it clear that the turnout will greatly exceed that of four years ago, but it is far less clear how that will translate to actual votes. It is equally unclear whether pollsters have been assuming the high-turnout, more Democratic electorate implied by early voting and the turnout in the special and general elections since Mr. Trump became president. Over the last few weeks, the share of voters indicating that they\u2019re \u201calmost certain\u201d to vote has increased by 10 points in Times/Siena polls, from 66 percent to 76 percent of the likely electorate.  In a few cases, the turnout in early voting has shown some polls were off in their projection of who will vote. Early voting in several Texas counties has already surpassed the projected electorate of a Times/Siena poll from early October, and the Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke seems likely to benefit from the higher turnout. A Monmouth poll of California\u2019s 48th District in coastal Orange County showed the Republican incumbent, Dana Rohrabacher, leading by two points with an electorate in which registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats by 18 points. The actual Republican advantage in early voting is down to 12 points and continues to drop as turnout increases. The final Times/Siena poll of California\u2019s 48th shows the Democrat Harley Rouda leading Mr. Rohrabacher narrowly with an electorate where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by 10 points, an indicator of the extent that Republicans are struggling in the wealthy suburban bastions of 20th century conservatism. Democrats can also hope that undecided voters will break their way. It is often supposed that voters will break against incumbents, and Republicans will be in trouble if there\u2019s merit to that assumption. No Republican incumbent has eclipsed 50 percent in any of our polls of the tossup districts. Undecided voters are also often thought to break toward the party out of power, and perhaps that\u2019s especially likely with stupendously well-funded Democrats spending millions to increase their name recognition in the final stretch. It\u2019s paying off for Democrats in the Times/Siena polls: On average, Democratic challengers are now known by 82 percent of voters in polls over the last 10 days, up from 60 percent in September. Astonishingly, it\u2019s enough for the Democrats to effectively deny the Republicans the advantage of incumbency that usually helps a party hold the House. In the battleground polls finished over the last 10 days, a larger share of the electorate now has a favorable view of the Democratic challengers than the Republican incumbents, with 48 percent of likely voters holding a favorable view of the Democratic candidate compared with just 46 percent who have a favorable view of the Republican incumbent.  All of this may be adding up to a late shift toward Democrats. The Times reported that both Democratic and Republican operatives see House polls as trending Democratic in the final days, and the last wave of Times/Siena polls are at least consistent with that possibility. Across the final Times/Siena polls finished over the weekend, Democrats improved their position by an average of three percentage points over the prior poll of the same district. And Democrats have shown surprising late strength in Times/Siena polls of districts that weren\u2019t previously thought to be top-tier contests, like Pennsylvania\u2019s 10th, Florida\u2019s 15th, Georgia\u2019s Sixth and Illinois\u2019s 14th. At the same time, Republicans have rushed to defend a tier of contests that seem even likelier to remain on their side, like South Carolina\u2019s First, Georgia\u2019s Seventh and Michigan\u2019s Sixth.  If well-funded Democrats are breaking through in this next tier of races, Democrats could easily win more than 45 seats. But late movement doesn\u2019t necessarily predict the final result. Just ask Mrs. Clinton, who gained slightly in the final polls taken in the weekend ahead of the 2016 election.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/upshot/two-vastly-different-election-outcomes-that-hinge-on-a-few-dozen-close-contests.html", "date": "2018-11-05 00:00:00", "author": "By Nate Cohn", "description": "Even modest late shifts among undecided voters or a slightly unexpected turnout could significantly affect results.", "title": "Two Vastly Different Election Outcomes That Hinge on a Few Dozen Close Contests"},
{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Wilbur L. Ross Jr. had been Commerce secretary for less than three months, and he was growing impatient. The billionaire investor entered office promising to renegotiate trade deals. But he had another, less visible priority: adding a question about citizenship status to the 2020 census, which the Commerce Department supervises. \u201cI am mystified that nothing has been done in response to my months-old request that we include the citizenship question,\u201d he groused in a May 2017 email to an aide tapped out on his iPhone. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Mr. Ross\u2019s tenacity paid off. In March he announced that the next census would in fact ask respondents whether they are American citizens. The backlash was immediate, with experts saying the question would deter immigrants and minorities from responding, leaving them badly undercounted. Lawsuits by state attorneys general, advocacy groups and a host of cities quickly followed. Pressed on whether partisan politics colored consideration of the question, Mr. Ross said in sworn testimony to Congress in March that he was responding \u201csolely\u201d to a Justice Department request for data to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act. He also said he knew of no talks with the White House about the matter. But that story has since unraveled. Internal government documents produced in the principal lawsuit on the issue, in New York, show Mr. Ross pressured the Justice Department to request the citizenship question, not the other way around. They also show the involvement of President Trump\u2019s chief strategist at the time, Stephen K. Bannon, in the discussions. After Mr. Bannon requested that Mr. Ross \u201ctalk to someone about the census,\u201d Mr. Ross met with Kris Kobach, a fierce immigration opponent whom President Trump had appointed to a panel on voter fraud. The federal judge in the main lawsuit ordered Mr. Ross to testify under oath, stating that \u201chis intent and credibility are directly at issue,\u201d but last month the Supreme Court at least temporarily blocked the testimony. Another deposition of a senior Justice Department official who worked with Mr. Ross on the question went ahead as scheduled. The lawsuit, which goes to trial on Monday, could have profound ramifications. Census figures determine not only where hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are spent, but how the House of Representatives \u2014 and by extension, the Electoral College \u2014 and other political districts are remapped every decade to reflect population changes. Because immigrants and minorities disproportionately vote Democratic, a depressed head count could also expand Republican Party control when new political boundaries are drawn in 2021. While Mr. Ross has insisted that there is no clear evidence that the citizenship question would deter people from filling out census forms, the Census Bureau\u2019s own researchers repeatedly have found just that. In a memo last fall and in summaries of focus groups this spring, they noted that a wide range of ethnic minorities had voiced fears that the government would use citizenship information to persecute or even deport them \u2014 and one group with Vietnamese heritage even abandoned a focus group after learning that the next census would ask about citizenship. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that reapportionment would be affected by a citizenship question, and it\u2019s hard to believe the administration doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d said Phil Sparks, a co-director of the nonpartisan Census Project, an alliance of groups with a stake in an accurate population count. \u201cThis is a political and partisan move on the part of the Trump administration to try to stack the deck on the census.\u201d Many critics see the question as the opening volley in an emerging conservative campaign to eliminate noncitizens entirely from population counts used for redistricting. The 14th Amendment requires the House to be apportioned based on \u201cthe whole number of persons in each state,\u201d and the Supreme Court has long ruled that the \u201cwhole number\u201d includes noncitizens. Asked for comment, the Commerce Department said this month that nothing in the documents contradicted the rationale Mr. Ross offered to Congress in March. \u201cExecutive branch officials discussing important issues prior to formulating policy is evidence of good government,\u201d a department spokesman, Kevin Manning, said. The court documents \u201creinforce that executive branch officials worked together to ensure that Secretary Ross received all of the information necessary to make an informed decision.\u201d Mr. Ross sought help early on with the citizenship question. But when Earl Comstock, Mr. Ross\u2019s head of policy and strategic planning, asked the Justice Department, he was rebuffed by its top immigration law adviser, James McHenry. \u201cJames said that Justice staff did not want to raise the question given the difficulties Justice was encountering in the press (the whole Comey matter),\u201d Mr. Comstock wrote in a later memo, referring to President Trump\u2019s decision that same month to fire the F.B.I. director James Comey. Mr. Comstock was shunted to Gene P. Hamilton, a Department of Homeland Security official who helped formulate immigration policy during the presidential transition. But he, too, demurred; Homeland Security \u201creally felt that it was best handled by the Department of Justice,\u201d Mr. Comstock wrote. Mr. Ross, meanwhile, was getting support from other sources, including Mr. Kobach, who earlier had pitched a hard-line immigration strategy to Mr. Trump in a bid to become secretary of Homeland Security. After meeting with Mr. Ross at Mr. Bannon\u2019s request that spring, Mr. Kobach reached out again in a July 2017 email, arguing that including noncitizens \u201cwho do not actually \u2018reside\u2019 in the United States\u201d in census figures used for reapportionment was a problem. His solution: Identify noncitizens by adding to the 2020 census a question on citizenship that already was asked in the American Community Survey, an annual census of economic and social matters covering a small fraction of the public. Mr. Ross followed up with a phone conference with Mr. Kobach 10 days later. (Neither Mr. Kobach nor Mr. Bannon responded to requests for comment.) Two months later, the Justice Department appeared suddenly willing to help. On Sept. 17, a top aide to Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent Mr. Sessions\u2019s cellphone number to Mr. Ross\u2019s chief of staff, Wendy Teramoto. \u201cIt sounds like we can do whatever you all need us to do,\u201d the aide wrote. \u201cThe AG is eager to assist.\u201d Mr. Ross spoke with Mr. Sessions, then ordered his general counsel to \u201cfollow up so we can resolve this issue today.\u201d Yet Mr. Ross dispatched weeks of emails demanding progress, to little avail. On Nov. 23, he joined Mr. Trump for Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago. Upon his return, he fired off another message to his general counsel. \u201cWe are out of time,\u201d it read. \u201cPlease set up a call for me tomorrow with whoever is the responsible person at Justice. We must have this resolved.\u201d The Justice Department\u2019s long-sought request finally materialized on Dec. 12. Three pages long, it called the citizenship question \u201ccritical\u201d to getting precise enough data on noncitizens to enforce the Voting Rights Act. Citizenship data from the American Community Survey, it said, was not granular enough. Census Bureau experts say that is untrue, noting that the Voting Rights Act has been enforced since 1965 with data from the community survey or its equivalent. Regardless, the new question sent Census Bureau staff scrambling. Because there are so few questions on the census, making accurate responses crucial, the bureau typically field-tests new questions for years before deciding whether to use them. Now Ron S. Jarmin, the bureau\u2019s acting director, had only months to complete that evaluation by April 1, the deadline to notify Congress of the 2020 questions. But inside the bureau, resistance to the question was growing, with the agency\u2019s chief scientist, John M. Abowd, concluding that the question was unnecessary. By melding existing data, he wrote, the bureau could give Justice more accurate citizenship data than could a census question \u2014 and more cheaply. A citizenship question \u201cis very costly, harms the quality of the census count, and would use substantially less accurate citizenship status data than are available from administrative sources,\u201d he wrote. It also would deter at least 630,000 households from completing the form. Mr. Jarmin, the acting bureau director, asked to brief the Justice Department on Mr. Abowd\u2019s findings. But Mr. Sessions personally rejected that, court documents show, ordering underlings not to consider ways of gathering citizenship data beyond the citizenship question. News of the request, meanwhile, unleashed storms of protest from demographers, former census directors, and stakeholders \u2014 shopping-center operators, philanthropies, even A.C. Nielsen, the marketing research colossus \u2014 that depend on accurate census results. Private experts and academics on the Census Scientific Advisory Board labeled the citizenship question \u201ca serious mistake which would result in a substantial lowering of the response rate.\u201d The comparative smattering of supporters included one former census director, some Republican state attorneys general and leaders, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. As Mr. Ross began the obligatory process of formally polling influential stakeholders, Mr. Jarmin scrounged for credible backers of the question. \u201cMost stakeholders will speak against the proposal,\u201d he wrote Michael R. Strain, the director of economic studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, in February. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to find someone thoughtful who can speak to the pros.\u201d Mr. Strain\u2019s response: \u201cNone of my colleagues at AEI would speak favorably about the proposal. Is it important that the person actually be in favor?\u201d Five weeks later, Mr. Ross announced that he was ordering the question added to the 2020 census. To some, the citizenship question dispute looks overblown. Before 1940, many general censuses did ask about citizenship status; since then the question has appeared on so-called long-form censuses or the American Community Survey, both polling a small slice of the population. Asking everyone, advocates say, is not so different. But some focus groups conducted by Census Bureau contractors since Mr. Ross\u2019s announcement suggest otherwise. In them, people of Hispanic, Chinese, Middle East, North African and Vietnamese heritage expressed skepticism and mistrust of the count and of assurances that the data would remain confidential. Already upset by administration policies and rhetoric, Middle East and North African respondents in Detroit and Los Angeles said the citizenship question was \u201can indicator that things were not going well for people \u2018like them.\u2019\u201d In three Latino focus groups, participants raised the citizenship question even before they could be asked about it. \u201cWhile all participants expressed the desire to be counted,\u201d the summary stated, \u201cfear of deportation outweighs any benefit.\u201d Whatever the result of the lawsuit in New York, the use of the citizenship question is likely to reach the Supreme Court, an outcome the Commerce Department has anticipated. \u201cSince this issue will go to the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Comstock, an aide to Mr. Ross, warned his boss in an email in August 2017, \u201cwe need to be diligent in preparing the administrative record.\u201d Replied Mr. Ross: \u201cWe should be very careful, about everything, whether or not it is likely to end up in the SC.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/us/wilbur-ross-commerce-secretary.html", "date": "2018-11-04 00:00:00", "author": "By Michael Wines", "description": "The census determines how political districts are mapped \u2014 and many immigrants are already saying they won\u2019t participate if asked about citizenship.", "title": "Inside the Trump Administration\u2019s Fight to Add a Citizenship Question to the Census"}
