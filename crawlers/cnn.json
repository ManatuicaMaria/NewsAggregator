The futuristic car, which has already made a buzz on the Formula E circuit, will pit its 360-degree sensors, computer processors, four electric motors, GPS, radar, lidar and hi-tech cameras against the hay bales, flint walls, trees and tight turns of Goodwood's 1.16-mile hill track in a race against the clock. \"We are excited that the Duke of Richmond has invited us to make history at Goodwood as we attempt the first ever fully -- and truly -- autonomous uphill climb using only artificial intelligence,\" said Roborace boss and Formula E champ Lucas di Grassi.   The 1,350 kg car, which was showcased at the Festival's Future Lab last year, was designed by Hollywood creative Daniel Simon, known for his work on films such as \"Oblivion,\" \"Tron\" and \"Captain America.\" Roborace developed the first driverless electric racing car last year, the Robocar \"devbot\", which can reach speeds of 199mph. The company plans to use similar cars in an all-electric driverless race series that will be part of the entertainment at Formula E.

{"content": "The two old foes, now good friends, will clash Friday in an 18-hole head-to-head, dubbed \"The Match,\" at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas, Nevada. And the pair, who have 19 majors between them, have already upped the ante by wagering a separate $200,000 out of their own pockets -- to benefit each other's chosen charities -- on whether Mickelson will birdie the first hole.  \"The tough thing was getting him to bite,\" said Mickelson, who first proposed a $100,000 bet, talking to CNN World Sport's Hines Ward in Las Vegas.  \"Not only did he take it, he doubled it. He doubled it, are you kidding me? That's awesome. I can't believe it.\"  Woods, who won the PGA Tour's season-ending Tour Championship in September for his first victory in five years, said the challenges would be \"escalating.\" \"We're trying to get in each other's heads,\" added the 42-year-old. Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videos  READ: How the world reacted to Woods' comeback victory 'Bragging rights' Former world No.1 Woods has always had the upper hand over his compatriot throughout their illustrious careers, and had won eight of his 14 majors before Mickelson clinched his first in 2004. Woods has 80 PGA Tour wins -- the second highest of all time -- to Mickelson's 43, and is widely expected to prevail at Shadow Creek after his remarkable return to form. An impressive comeback season culminated in the Tour Championship win following a fourth major back surgery in April 2017.      Mickelson staged a renaissance of his own this year with a first win since his British Open triumph in 2013, and is adamant he can take down his former nemesis.    \"The bragging rights that will go on for months and years after this will be just as valuable [as money],\" said Mickelson. \"Because if I'm able to come out on top I am the worst guy to lose to. I'll find a way to make sure you never forget.\"  \"He's that guy,\" said Woods.  \"That makes me a fun guy to beat,\" fired back Mickelson.  'Smack talk' The two players will wear microphones for the match, meaning those stumping up the $19.99 to watch on pay-per-view in the US will be able to hear their interactions on the course.  \"You know Tiger is an underrated smack talker,\" said Mickelson, 48. \"He doesn't get the credit for his smack talk because he does it so understated and he does it under his breath so nobody else can hear other than you.  \"That funny side of him is going to come out.\"  READ: Cheyenne Woods on being Tiger's niece  The pair were known to have a frosty relationship in their competitive heyday, but involvement in the US Ryder Cup task force, Presidents Cups and Mickelson's support through Woods' injuries have bonded them in recent years.  At a news conference in Las Vegas to promote \"The Match,\" they stood face to face like boxers before a prize fight but dissolved into giggles seconds later.   With both players having tasted success again this year, Mickelson predicted a \"phenomenal\" 2019. When asked who will win the next major between them, the left hander pointed to the next major on the calendar, the Masters in April.  \"It's at Augusta, we've both had success there,\" he laughed.  Woods, a four-time Masters champion, added: \"I mean, there's seven coats [green jackets] between us.  \"But I have more.\" \"You see the subtlety?\" said Mickelson. \"He pays a compliment and then he throws a dig.\"  If he wins, Mickelson is already planning a repeat of his \"worm\" dance routine that lit up social media earlier this season in an advert for his clothing sponsor. \"It's very possible that I might do the worm across the green,\" he said. \"I'm not sure how it's all going to play out because I don't want to rub it in too early but that could come out.\" Woods said he was safe given Mickelson vowed only to perform it if he wins, but he admits he is under \"pressure\" to come out on top to avoid seeing the worm.   \"How he responds to that pressure. That's the real question,\" said Mickelson.

{"content": "The exhaustive report, the product of 30,000 hours of work and 50 hours of oral evidence to Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), focused on a still-uncomfortable yet distant counter-terrorism struggle against al Qaeda a decade ago. It largely exonerated UK agencies in the direct abuse of terror suspects. It concluded UK officials had never engaged in physical abuse of detainees between 2001 and 2010, had only been \"involved\" in it twice, and witnessed it firsthand 13 times. Only nine cases of UK officials delivering \"verbal abuse\" to detainees were reported over the nine-year period. But it noted there were 127 incidents in which UK officials were made aware of mistreatment by foreign services, and that in 232 cases UK officials continued to supply intelligence or questions to be asked in interrogation by foreign allies, despite being aware of detainee mistreatment. \"It is easy to criticize with the benefit of hindsight,\" said Dominic Grieve, a member of Parliament and the chairman of the ISC, in a statement accompanying the report.  \"We wish to be absolutely clear that we do not seek to blame individual officers acting under immense pressure. Our findings must be viewed in the context in which the events took place. The pace of work after 9/11, both in Afghanistan and London, was frenetic: We do not underestimate the pressure that the agencies experienced whilst dealing with the imperative to protect the UK and prevent another attack on the scale of 9/11.\" \"With that said, more could have been done at an agency and ministerial level to seek to influence US behavior. More could also have been done to distance themselves from mistreatment of detainees. The intense scrutiny and at times scolding language of the report contrasts with rhetoric in the White House over detainee abuse. President Donald Trump, as a candidate, declared he believes \"torture works\". US officials deny that is the case, or that US officials abuse detainees.  The current director of the CIA, Gina Haspel, has said she would not restart the controversial \"enhanced interrogation\" program. But she has faced questions over her role as supervisor of a CIA \"black site\" in Thailand where harsh interrogations took place, and had a role in the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes. The report emphasized the distance between US hardline political rhetoric and European intelligence practice, many issues of which remain current as the US and its European allies struggle to remove foreign ISIS fighters from custody in northern Syria so they can be tried in Western courts. A UK security source said after the report's release: \"Today, we do things differently. We have learned the lessons of those difficult post-9/11 years and structures have matured, both in SIS [MI6, Britain's foreign intelligence service] and across government.\" While many of its conclusions were historical, the ISC report did call on the UK government to spell out within three months its current policy over UK airspace and territory being used for any possible American rendition flights, saying it was \"astonishing\" how little progress had been made in this area. It also reported that there were three cases between 2001-2010 in which MI6 or MI5  (British foreign and domestic intelligence, respectively) paid or offered to pay unspecified others to conduct an \"extraordinary rendition\" for them. In the era of ISIS's brutality and the at-times zero-tolerance Western response to it, the report's focus on a handful of misdemeanors highlighted the cultural change and increased scrutiny of British spies since former UK Prime Minister David Cameron ordered it in 2010. British Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the ISC report in a statement, and said the focus for the UK at the time had been \"doing everything possible to prevent further loss of innocent life, both here and overseas ... With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that UK personnel were working within a new and challenging operating environment for which, in some cases, they were not prepared.\" A UK security source said the post 9/11 challenge to intelligence agencies was \"simply unprecedented in its scale.\" The source added that MI6  had few counter-terror sources or experience holding detainees. The UK security source said: \"Ethical and professional standards, integrity and values run through everything we do... Legislation and oversight are vital to us; staff must have the confidence that the legal basis for our activity is solid. We have drawn the right lessons for the years under review, and that they are embedded in the practices of the modern SIS [MI6].\" The source added British spies wanted \"a robust system of independent oversight and accountability: it is a critical part of our values, and of the democratic order that this service seeks to protect ... We have had to learn some tough lessons. Today we face unprecedented levels of threat, be that from terrorism or hybrid warfare. Brave men and women who work for us, often at great personal risk, mean that MI6 is active and effective.\" ", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/28/uk/uk-detainee-abuse-report-intl/index.html", "description": "UK lawmakers have delivered a stark assessment on the conduct of British spies and their US allies after 9/11, concluding it was \"inexcusable\" that UK officials tolerated the counter-terror practices of the time.", "title": "UK officials tolerated 'inexcusable' abuse of US detainees", "author": "Nick Paton Walsh, CNN", "date": "2018-06-28 14:28:02"},

{"content": "Ahead of her blockbuster semifinal at the French Open against 2016 winner Garbine Muguruza, her coach Darren Cahill stayed up late scouting.  \"I was up until 3 in the morning watching all of their matches last night,\" Cahill told CNN.  It paid off, as Halep made a second straight final on the clay at Roland Garros and retained her No. 1 ranking at Muguruza's expense with a 6-1 6-4 victory Thursday in Paris.  READ: Resurgent Rafael Nadal reaches French Open semifinals READ: Djokovic stunned by Cecchinato Cahill is widely regarded as one of the top coaches in tennis, his past charges including Andre Agassi and Lleyton Hewitt. The Australian was chuffed as he chatted in the player restaurant but not ecstatic. He knows there is still a match to come, and a massive one, against 10th-seed Sloane Stephens.  Stephens won the all-American duel in the second semifinal on Court Philippe-Chatrier, claiming her sixth set in as many tries against her compatriot and friend, Madison Keys. Last year during the French Open while recovering from foot surgery, Stephens went to a wedding in Ireland.  Two months into her comeback, she lifted the trophy at the US Open by downing Keys.  And just like in September, Stephens put down a marker by breaking early Thursday and never relinquished that advantage in her 6-4 6-4 triumph.  Impressive feat Other than the legendary Williams sisters, Stephens became the first American to make the final at the French Open -- faster surfaces have generally suited North Americans -- since Jennifer Capriati in 2001.  Halep owns a 5-2 record against Stephens -- winning four straight -- with her ranking and clay-court pedigree understandably making her the favorite in Saturday's title decider.  But Stephens does have that grand slam title in her pocket and usually produces her finest tennis on the big stages. Roland Garros certainly counts in that regard, even if it is the most intimate of the four majors. The 25-year-old has won all six finals she has contested.  Stephens' post US Open woes -- losing eight in a row -- are a distant memory. \"I think life came at me fast after the US Open,\" Stephens, the Miami Open champion in March, succinctly put it.  Halep, meanwhile, has succumbed in all three of her grand slam finals, each in three sets including twice at the French Open.  \"I have two more days until I will play the final, so I will stay chill,\" Halep. \"I will relax. And then we will see what is going to happen Saturday, but for sure I will fight for every ball.\" She added later: \"I lost three times until now and no one died, so it will be okay. But I will be, I think, more confident, because I have a lot of experience.\" Whatever happens, expect some lengthy rallies. Halep and Stephens are two of the top movers in the game.  Turnaround from Cincinnati  Although Halep improved to 2-0 against Muguruza on clay, the last time they played, on hard courts in Cincinnati in August, she tallied one game.  It led Halep to apologize to her fans, and she has many. Last year Halep ended Agnieszka Radwanska's six-year reign as the WTA's fan favorite.  Cahill insists Halep won't be thinking about her past near misses in grand slam finals, the latest coming in January at the Australian Open when she let a break lead slip at 4-3 in the third against Caroline Wozniacki.   Twelve months ago at Roland Garros, a free swinging Jelena Ostapenko overturned a set and 3-0 deficit against the 26-year-old.  \"I would say the loss she had last year here was a bit more gut wrenching than the one she had in Australia,\" said Cahill. \"She wants to make amends and she'll be focused to do that and won't be thinking of last year's final. The only thing she'll be thinking about it is the opponent on the other side of the net. \"I'm really proud of her. Coming in here, there's a bit of pressure on her obviously -- this is her best chance, always at the French Open, to play her best tennis and make another final. \"And today, Simona was good enough to go out and execute a bit of a different game plan.\" When he reviewed Halep's matches against Muguruza in Stuttgart and in the Fed Cup in 2015, Cahill said the world No. 3 was able to \"dominate the rallies, and it starts with the first balls.\"  On Thursday, Halep pounced on her first ball returning the Muguruza serve, claiming 56% of return points. Halep led that category entering the year's second major of players who have played at least 15 matches, though was at 49.7%. For her part, Muguruza felt she didn't serve well.  'Had to be aggressive' Halep also struck more winners than power-player Muguruza, 16 to 14.  \"I knew that I had to be aggressive like her,\" said Halep.  Muguruza hadn't dropped a set en route to the semifinals, coming off a dismantling of two-time champion Maria Sharapova on Wednesday. Muguruza got herself back into the match in the second set, but surrendered a 4-2 lead.  \"Simona was all over the place, very aggressive,\" Sam Sumyk, Muguruza's coach, told CNN a few moments after congratulating Cahill. \"She had every answer pretty much so I think she deserved it.  \"(Muguruza) could have also done things a bit better here and there, but if I look at the match, the best player won.\" That applied to the second semifinal.  Keys' radar was off at the US Open in the contest that lasted 61 minutes. It was still off on the clay, with the 13th seed committing 41 unforced errors.  They hugged when it ended and Stephens applauded as her pal made her way off center court.   \"Obviously making the semis and finals, there is not much more you can ask for in a player,\" said Stephens. \"And I think I have done really well, but I'd like to keep going.\"  Visit CNN.com/tennis for more news, features and videos  So, of course, would Halep.

{"content": "Ali Bashar, 20, who was previously known to police, fled to Iraq via Istanbul on June 2, according to officials. A second suspect, a 35-year-old Turkish citizen, is in custody. In a press conference in Wiesbaden on Thursday, officials said the victim, Susanna Maria Feldman, was reported missing by her mother on May 23 after she had gone out with her friends the previous evening. The police did not initially investigate it as a crime because the teenager was often truant. By the time the police opened an investigation, Bashar and seven other family members, all of whom lived in a refugee center in Wiesbaden, had fled using identification papers that German authorities failed to identify as suspect. The plane tickets contained different names from those given on the residence documents for Bashar and his family, officials said.  Bashar was first linked with the case after a 13-year-old refugee told police in Wiesbaden Sunday that the Iraqi man had raped and killed Feldman.  The teenager's body was found by police Wednesday close to a railway track in the Erbenheim area of Wiesbaden. Prosecutor Achim Thoma said that strangulation was the cause of death. Bashar arrived in Germany in October 2015 and moved to Wiesbaden with his parents and siblings in April the following year, according to police. He had been involved in several incidents of low-level violence and is a suspect in the rape of an 11-year-old girl in March this year, authorities said, but there had been no reason to arrest Bashar before the Feldman case. The second suspect, a Turkish national who arrived in Germany in May 2017 and later filed an asylum claim, was arrested at his home in Wiesbaden-Erbenheim Wednesday evening.  'Nothing worse in the world' Her mother, Diana Feldman, used Facebook to post updates about her daughter's disappearance. \"There is nothing worse for a mother in the world than not to know where her child is,\" she wrote on May 25, two days after the teenager went missing.   On June 1, in the absence of any news, she posted an open letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel from the Feldman family, imploring her to help.  According to the Central Council of Jews, Susanna Feldman was a member of the Jewish community in the nearby city of Mainz. The council learned of the news \"with deep dismay,\" it said in a statement, but warned against speculation about the motive.  The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) quickly laid the blame at Merkel's door, criticizing her decision to allow more than a million migrants and refugees to enter the country in 2015. \"Are you still sleeping well, Mrs. Merkel?\" the party wrote on Facebook.  The AfD won 91 seats in Germany's federal election last September and became the official opposition party in parliament after running on an anti-refugee, anti-Islam platform.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/07/europe/germany-iraqi-asylum-seeker-warrant-intl/index.html", "description": "German police have issued an international arrest warrant for an Iraqi asylum-seeker suspected of the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl in western Germany.", "title": "Iraqi asylum-seeker wanted over murder of girl in Germany", "author": "Sophie Rebmann, Nadine Schmidt and Judith Vonberg, CNN", "date": "2018-06-07 16:36:33"},
{"content": "The law, which came into effect Friday, has re-ignited a fierce national debate about the role of religion in politics and what it means to be German.   \"The cross is a fundamental symbol of our Bavarian identity and way of life.  It stands for elementary values such as charity, human dignity and tolerance,\" declared Bavarian State Premier Markus Soder at a cabinet meeting in April when the new requirement was announced.  He then walked out and nailed a cross to the wall of the lobby in the Bavarian State Chancellery. Parts of Germany have been grappling with a crisis of identity after the country accepted more than a million refugees in 2015, many of whom are Muslims.  Many arrived across the border from Austria, entering Germany via Bavaria, one of Germany's most politically and socially conservative states. It also has one of the highest proportions of Christians -- in the 2011 census, over 75% of Bavarians identified as Roman Catholic or Protestant, compared to 62% nationwide. Bavaria's ruling party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), has been steadily losing voters to the far-right, anti-Muslim Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.  The \"Kreuzpflicht\" or \"crucifix obligation,\" ushered in before new elections in October, may be one attempt to win voters back. 'Law could create unrest' The AfD, which became the first far-right party in decades to enter German parliament following elections last year, criticized the new law as a superficial piece of politics. \"The Christian cross is being turned into an election accessory, while the conservatives refuse to protect our basic values with real actions,\" said the AfD's co-chair, Alice Weidel, in a statement in April. Bavaria's Christian leaders have also expressed concern. Cardinal Reinhard Marx, Archbishop of Munich and Freising, said displaying the cross should not be mandatory and that he feared the law would create \"division, unrest and adversity.\"   \"It is a symbol that opposes violence, injustice, sin and death. It is not a symbol against other people,\" said Marx in an April interview with German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.  Archbishop Ludwig Schick of Bamberg in northern Bavaria welcomed the prospect of more Christian crosses appearing in the state. \"Christians are happy when they see a cross,\" he wrote on Twitter on May 2, adding that the symbol held a powerful meaning for followers of Christ: \"In the cross is healing, in the cross is life, in the cross is hope.\" But, like Marx, he has also stressed the importance of the cross as a symbol of inclusivity, not hostility. It is \"a sign of unity, reconciliation, peace, brotherhood, solidarity,\" he told radio station Bayerischer Rundfunk in April. 'Islam does not belong to Germany' Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has faced a public backlash for her handling of the refugee crisis. In response, she appointed Bavarian CSU leader Horst Seehofer to be the Ministry of Interior and \"Heimat\" -- a controversial word that translates as \"home\" or \"homeland\" but also signals nostalgia for German tradition. The word is widely used by the AfD and was cited frequently in the \"blood and soil\" propaganda of the Nazi regime. Seehofer has promised to crack down on asylum applications and speed up deportations. In a March interview, Seehofer told Germany's largest tabloid, BILD: \"Islam does not belong to Germany,\" mimicking a central slogan of the AfD and adding: \"Germany was shaped by Christianity.\"    \"The Muslims who live among us naturally do belong to Germany,\" he added. \"Of course, that does not mean that we should, out of a false consideration of others, give up our traditions and customs. Muslims need to live with us, not next to us or against us.\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/31/europe/bavaria-germany-crosses-public-buildings-intl/index.html", "description": "From Friday, every public building in the southern German state of Bavaria is required to display a Christian cross at the entrance to greet visitors.", "title": "Bavaria: New law requires crosses in all public buildings", "author": "Atika Shubert and Judith Vonberg, CNN", "date": "2018-05-31 17:07:45"},

The high rainfall had caused zoo cages to flood and authorities had initially been unable to verify the whereabouts of cats, sparking fears of a mass breakout.  In reality, the animals had climbed to higher spots that were not visible from outside the cages, Potzsch said.  The cages were being checked by structural engineers to determine whether the animals can stay remain inside their enclosures or have to be placed in more secure places, he added.  The Eifel Zoo, which is located on the outskirts of Lunebach, around 11 miles (18 kilometers) from the Belgian border, is home to about 400 animals, according to the zoo's website. These include a Siberian tiger and African lions. Yannick Becker, who lives just over a mile from the zoo, posted video and images of flooding on the River Prum, which flows just to the east of the zoo.  \"There hasn't been a flood like this here for at least 70 years,\" Becker told CNN. He said he had heard from the fire department that two storms had collided to cause unusually high levels of rainfall.  \"As far as I know, a dam broke in the Eifel Zoo, which caused the area to be flooded,\" he added.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/01/europe/germany-zoo-animal-breakout-intl/index.html", "description": "A bear was shot dead after it escaped from an enclosure at a zoo in western Germany on Friday, authorities have said.

{"content": "The Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, is a law professor who has never before held political office, and who has been accused of embellishing parts of his resume.  But Conte's lack of political experience may not matter as he won't even be the most powerful person in the government. His two deputies are the leaders of the two largest parties that emerged from the inconclusive March 4 ballot, and nothing will get done without their say-so. One of them, the new interior minister, promised during the election campaign to expel half a million illegal immigrants from Italy, and has shared anti-migrant memes on social media. The other is the young university dropout leader of an anti-establishment party that has surged in the polls in recent years. Matteo Salvini: The anti-immigrant leader in charge of the interior ministry Matteo Salvini, the 45-year-old far-right League party leader who promised during the election campaign to expel half a million illegal immigrants from Italy, became one of the country's new deputy prime ministers as well as the new interior minister. Hours before his party announced it would be forming a governing coalition, Salvini shared a video on Facebook appearing to show a man of African origin plucking a pigeon, with the words \"Go home!!!\" Salvini has often used fiery rhetoric to boost his party's popularity and push a more nationalist agenda. In August 2016, Italian news agency ANSA reported him as calling for ethnic cleansing in Italy.  \"We need mass ethnic cleansing in Italy, street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood, with strong manners if we need to,\" ANSA reported.  During the election campaign, Salvini and the League seized on the anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and pushed a Trump-esque slogan of \"Italians first.\"   Luigi Di Maio: The college dropout leading labor and industry  Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio was named the other deputy prime minister. He'll also head up the ministry of labor and economic development.  The 31-year-old is the son of a neo-fascist local politician from Avellino near Naples. He previously acted as the deputy speaker of the Italian lower house. His spectacular political ascendancy comes despite the fact he dropped out of university before complete his law degree. Prior to entering politics, he was a webmaster.  Giovanni Tria: The second choice for economy minister  Last week, Giovanni Tria, a 69-year-old economics professor, said he was worried about some of the coalition government's policies. This week, he became Italy's economy minister.  Tria will take up the role after Italian President Sergio Mattarella vetoed the coalition's first choice for the job, Paolo Savona, over his criticism of the euro. Tria may be a more acceptable name to the Italian President, but the coalition is promising a spending and tax-cutting binge that has rattled investors and could contain the seeds of a new European crisis. Italy's debt is at a record 132% of GDP, the second worst ratio in the region after Greece. Tria has been lukewarm on the coalition's plan to provide a universal basic income -- a central campaign promise from M5S. \"We do not know yet what this 'citizenship income' will be, and therefore, the resources required and breadth of the public beneficiaries,\" he wrote in Formiche magazine in late May.  But he did appear more amenable to the coalition's proposal for a flat tax. \"More interesting is the objective of the flat tax, which coincides with the objective of reducing the tax burden as a condition for a policy of growth,\" Tria wrote before his name was put forward for the economy role. \"More worrying is the fact that it's not at all clear what would be the direction of the coalition government that it's forming on industrial policy issues,\" he added. \"Their plans on fiscal policy would result in a huge increase in the deficit, a blatant violation of EU deficit rules,\" said Federico Santi, an analyst at Eurasia Group, said of the coalition.  Paolo Savona: The European affairs minister who is euroskeptic Savona, a euroskeptic 81-year-old economist, was supposed to be the economy minister before his appointment was blocked. Instead, he will take on Brussels as Italy's new European affairs minister, which could be somewhat awkward after he bashed Germany's economic policy in his most recent book published in May.  \"Germany hasn't changed its vision of its role in Europe after the end of Nazism, even if it has abandoned the idea of imposing it militarily,\" he wrote.  In the book, he also wrote of the need to prepare the Italian government for a \"plan B\" which could see the country leave the bloc.  \"The authorities have the duty to prepare and carry out two different plans, one necessary for remaining in the EU and in the euro, and another to leave if the accords don't change and the negative effects increase.\" He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he specialized in economy in 1961 and has since held a long and distinguished career as an economics professor, according to his CV.  He was also briefly Italy's industry minister between 1993 and 1994 before working with Berlusconi's government in 2005.  Lorenzo Fontana: The radical anti-abortion advocate overseeing family affairs Described in Italian media as \"the most far-right minister in the new government,\" 38-year-old Lorenzo Fontana is now the new family and disability minister.  He studied political science at the University of Padova and history at the European University of Rome. Fontana has been a member of the League party since he was 20, according to his website.  Between 2012 and 2014, he headed up its delegation in the European Parliament. He was also a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and Delegation for relations with Iraq.  But it has been Fontana's radical positions on abortion, women's rights, LGBT rights and immigrations on social media platforms that has garnered him the most attention at home.  Alfonso Bonafede: 'Mr. Wolf' in charge of justice  Alfonso Bonafede has taken on the role of justice minister. A Sicilian-born lawyer, he lives in Florence, where he met and collaborated with Conte.  Known in Italian media as one of Di Maio's closest associates and friends, he has been nicknamed \"Mr. Wolf\" for his ability to resolve problems.  The lawyer started his political activity back in 2006 when he started attending M5S meetings in Florence. By 2009, he would stand -- but ultimately lose -- as a mayoral candidate against Matteo Renzi, who went on to become the country's prime minister between 2014 and 2016, La Repubblica newspaper reported.  Sergio Costa: The environmental warrior  The new minister for the environment has been named as 59-year-old Sergio Costa.  He is perhaps best known as former environmental police chief of Naples, where he led the so-called \"Land of the Fires\" investigation -- a probe into a mutlibillion-dollar scheme by the Camorra organized crime group who allegedly illegally disposed of toxic waste from all over the country in the region, Associated Press reported.  He was, according to local media, previously a Brigadier general of the Carabinieri army and commander of the Carabinieri forestry branch in Campania, local media has reported.

{"content": "The 16-time grand slam champion has won an unprecedented 10 French Open titles and is odds-on favorite to win an 11th. No player in history has won as many grand slam titles at a single tournament.   The Spaniard won the French Open on his debut as a 19-year-old and came into this year's event with a 79-2 win-loss record at Roland Garros. Recently, he compiled a remarkable streak of 25 straight victories on clay and also set a record of 50 consecutive sets won on a single surface.  But what makes the greatest clay-courter of his generation so good on the slow red dirt?  Former grand slam winners Pat Cash, Mats Wilander and Yannick Noah talked CNN Sport through the Mallorcan's game. READ: Who can beat the King of Clay in Paris? READ: Why Rafael Nadal is all at sea during his time off Athleticism \"He's unbelievably fast, and he can keep going forever, which helps on the clay,\" Australia's Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion, said in an interview at Roland Garros.  \"He keeps getting the ball back, his speed and athleticism is just phenomenal.  \"His footwork on the clay is amazing, I don't think I've ever seen anybody move that quick on the clay.\" Top spin Nadal's technique also sets him apart.  \"We have never seen a player hit so much top spin before,\" said Cash, who now coaches American Coco Vandeweghe.  \"The power he puts into the shots and the top spin is just very, very hard to control on a slow court over five sets.  \"The quicker the courts get, the harder it is going to be for him to actually create that top spin and the ball skidding through.  \"But when he has a little bit of extra time, and he can move back further and give himself more time to hit, he's able to hit the ball with more spin, which enables the ball to bounce higher and push the opponent around.\" Mental strength In addition to his technical abilities, Nadal's mental strength is what truly sets him apart from the rest of the field.  \"Mentally, he's just ferocious,\" Cash said.  \"Clay is one of the toughest surfaces to be successful at, because you have to be focused all the time, the momentum can change very quickly.  \"On grass or other courts, you can hold your serve, or hit a couple of big serves and stay in it, but not on the clay, you have to be persistent all the time.\"    Rainy day    For Nadal to lose at Roland Garros for only a third time, three things need to happen, according to three-time French Open winner Wilander.   \"Rafa has to play somebody he is intimidated by in terms of talent, it has to be a rainy, wet day here at Roland Garros and Rafa must not play very well,\" the former top-ranked Swede told CNN in Paris.  Nadal excels when it's hot as his heavy top-spin shots kick up high -- rain tends to dampen one of his main weapons, according to Wilander.  \"With Alexander Zverev, I think we are seeing the building of the perfect player who could beat Rafa,\" he adds.  Visit CNN.com/tennis for more news, features and videos \"He's tall, a great two-handed backhand, a big serve, a bit reminiscent of Robin Soderling, the tall Swede who beat Rafa here once.\" Noah, the only French man since 1946 to win at Roland Garros when he beat Wilander in the 1983 final, says you have to think outside of the box to beat Nadal. \"I'd serve under arm and I'd hit only drop shots,\" he jokes in an interview with Cash for CNN's Open Court at Roland Garros. \"And if he's at the net I'd hit it at him.

{"content": "Thursday marked the second time in less than two weeks that Conte had been approved for the role. After being appointed by Italian President Sergio Mattarella last Wednesday following his nomination by the League and Five Star, Conte was forced to abandon his attempt to form a government the next day after the president rejected his choice of finance minister. The two populist, euroskeptic parties secured the most votes in the March 4 election. But voters did not return a majority to any single party, and neither politician would concede the top job to the other.  The appointment of Conte, a law professor with no political experience, came after weeks of political wrangling among the jigsaw of political parties returned by voters in March. Conte said that he supported center-left political ideals when he joined the Five Star Movement during the election campaign. He was mentioned as a potential public administration minister in the event that the Five Star Movement won a clear majority. Conte's first nomination was briefly called into question after media reports surfaced accusing him of embellishing parts of his curriculum vitae. Efforts to reach Conte for comment at the time were unsuccessful. He studied in the United Kingdom and United States, according to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, where he perfected his English so he could teach international law. The Five Star movement rejected accusations that Conte exaggerated his qualifications.  \"There's no reference [in his CV] to masters or other university titles, but the simple and accurate description of his work as a scholar and university professor,\" the movement said in a post on its official blog.  Work experience scrutinized In one part of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Conte says he \"perfected and updated his studies\" at New York University from 2008 to 2012. An NYU spokeswoman said in a statement that university records did not indicate Conte was a student or ever had an appointment as a faculty member. The school said that even though Conte had no \"official status\" at NYU, \"he was granted permission to conduct research in the NYU law library between 2008 and 2014, and he invited an NYU law professor to serve on the board of an Italian law journal.\" Conte also claimed he taught at the University of Malta in the summer of 1997 for the \"international course of study entitled: European Contract and Banking Law.\" The University of Malta told CNN that it \"has no record of Giuseppe Conte ever forming part of the resident academic staff.\" \"However this does not exclude that he may have been involved in lecturing duties during short courses organized in the summer of 1997 by the now defunct Foundation for International Studies (FIS) which was a separate entity that worked in close collaboration with the University of Malta,\" a spokesman for the university said. And some academics from the Faculty of Law \"seem to remember him being one of the lecturers during this short course,\" the spokesman added.  Conte also said he conducted scientific research in 2000 at the Sorbonne in Paris. A university spokesman said in a statement to CNN that after internal inquiries at the Sorbonne School of Law, the Sorbonne Doctorate School of Law and the Direction of International Relations, \"the University Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne cannot confirm that Mr. Conte has 'studied' at our university that summer.\" \"Nevertheless, he could have come to visit some colleagues in a laboratory without informing our services,\" he added.   Conte also said he conducted studies at Yale University and Duquesne University in the US for three months in the fall of 1992 \"to further his study of the North American contract law.\" Yale said it would perform a \"thorough check of the records\" and would not comment further until the checks were complete. Duquesne University confirmed Conte was at the university in the early 1990s \"as part of an affiliation with the Villa Nazareth program, a cultural institution in Rome founded by Domenico Cardinal Tardini that fostered international student exchanges.\" The program \"enabled students from Rome to attend graduate programs at Duquesne University and undergraduates from Duquesne to attend classes at Villa Nazareth.\" Duquesne said Conte \"was not enrolled as a student.\" But he was engaged in legal research and in advancing the work of \"our affiliation with Villa Nazareth, working on legal issues related to a charitable trust that funded the program, and helping select the program's participants,\" the school said. Apparently, the accusations were not enough to sideline him. Promises of change Conte was born in the southern region of Puglia and lives in Florence where he teaches civil law at the University of Florence.   He is separated from his wife with whom he has a 10-year-old son, according to a biography presented by the Five Star Movement provided to the press.  After a meeting Thursday evening with Mattarella behind closed doors, Conte addressed reporters, announcing the list of approved ministers and laying out his vision for the future. \"We will work intensely to realize the political goals of our agreement, and we will work with determination to improve the lives of all Italians,\" Conte said. In a speech following his first appointment last week, Conte emphasized the importance of Italy remaining in the European Union and promised that his would be a \"government of change.\" \"I will be the defense attorney for all Italians,\" he said, echoing populist sentiments often heard by the Five Star Movement politicians during the campaign.   It was Conte's choice of finance minister -- Paolo Savona, an economist known for his skeptical views of Europe -- that stymied his initial attempt to form a government last week. Savona will still enter the new cabinet -- as Minister for European Affairs -- and the crucial role of Finance Minister will be taken by Giovanni Tria, an economics professor not publicly affiliated with any political party. Those who oppose Conte and the League-Five Star Movement coalition cite a 58-page contract the two leaders signed prior to naming Conte.  In the dossier, they outlined an ambitious spending package but did not provide concrete plans to pay for it. Vincenzo Boccia, the head of Italy's main industrial lobby, expressed concern about the economic stability of the plan at a conference in Rome on Wednesday. \"Debt remains our enemy,\" he said, according to Reuters.

{"content": "In your legs you feel the heaviness of the four or five other games already played that weekend. Your body has been bruised and knocked, your lungs emptied.  You're about to take to a pitch thousands of miles from home, where your team could be just 14 minutes away from a trophy. For many international rugby sevens players, these circumstances will feel familiar.  And while some will be calm in front of a vibrant crowd of thousands, others will be beset with nerves. It's a nature of the game -- and sport more generally -- of which former sevens coach Ben Ryan is well aware. At all levels and to different degrees, players feel pressure; the effects can be overpowering.  \"I've had players who have got to Olympic finals and it was as though they were running out to lunch break with their mates -- they felt absolutely no pressure at all,\" Ryan, who lead Fiji to Olympic gold in 2016, tells CNN. \"Then I've seen people on the other end that will self-sabotage -- will do things on purpose to derail themselves from their performance because the pressure has got too much and they want to find an excuse.  \"Whatever that is -- in a running race falling over on purpose, dropping a ball or getting injured. I've seen players who were too nervous to take the field ... They'd put this pressure on themselves that didn't exist.\" READ: Swapping sacks for sevens in the off-season Highs and lows In recent years, Ryan has been hailed as something of a sevens guru. After coaching Fiji to two world championship titles and Olympic gold at Rio 2016, he was cast as the country's hero -- gifted his own plot of land, granted an honorary title, and immortalized on national currency. His guidance is perhaps the most sought-after in the game. Alongside his role as a sevens ambassador with HSBC this season, he's been helping France as a consultant coach where the players revere him with \"superstar\" awe.  He knows better than anyone that there are aspects of sevens that make the mental strain on players particularly acute. Take, for example, the tournament format, where a team's games are staggered every few hours over the course of a weekend.  \"You're on this roller coaster of winning and losing,\" explains Ryan. \"Momentum is everything in sevens. Teams who get a good early win or beat a bigger side -- you can see them literally lift; that synergy can come.  \"But if a team has a defeat that they don't expect or an injury or something then you've got to try to press the reset button. Nearly every team gets the high and the lows.\" Then within games, individual decision making is crucial. Sevens is blessed with some of the quickest athletes in the world, and with so much space to play with, defenders are exposed.  READ: The rugby captain raised in a one-room home Miss a tackle, and your opponent will be streaking towards the try line; rush out the defensive line and you've left a gaping hole behind you; dive in a dead ruck, and there's one fewer body in an already stretched defense. There are wider factors, too. The HSBC Sevens World Series criss-crosses the globe, from Sydney to Singapore, London to Las Vegas. Travel-induced fatigue can be mentally and physically draining.  \"We set up PhDs around jet-lag, we did saliva tests, we did all sorts of stuff,\" says Ryan of his time coaching England. \"We talked far too much about jet-lag to the players that they all felt they had jet-lag even if they didn't. It became a far bigger issue.\" A helping hand While the physical effects of anxiety -- butterflies, high heart rate, and nausea -- usually dissipate during exercise, cognitive anxiety -- worry, fear of failure, and feeling pressurized -- can be debilitating.   The mind can tire as much as the legs and lungs. Helping players stay mentally unburdened is crucial in a game of fine margins. \"You reduce that anxiety by letting players know what their roles are and what they're supposed to be doing,\" explains Ryan.  \"At the high end, coaching isn't teaching someone to pass or kick. It's about man-management skills, understanding a person, and consistently behaving the right way towards them. \"Those sort of things around belief and purpose and giving players security as a coach -- that they can go on the field without feeling they're going to get it in the neck if it doesn't work out.\" \"There's triggers you can have with individuals -- like an imaginary piece of paper being thrown away when you've missed a tackle to reset yourself. Other players might just like to be told how good they are.\" READ: Fijian rugby players put through their paces on dramatic dune landscape When he took Fiji to the Rio Olympics, Ryan says he hit \"that beautiful sweet-spot\" in coaching. His team breezed through the group stages, before overcoming New Zealand, Japan, and crushing Great Britain 43-7 in the final.  \"I was 100% certain for the whole tournament that we were going to win the gold medal and so were all the players,\" he says. \"We weren't feeling cocky or arrogant, we just felt over-competent. Preparation can reduce your anxiety and that was certainly the case with me.\" 'Remarkable athletes' In terms of mental preparation, 15-a-side rugby is a different beast to sevens -- something that Brian O'Driscoll, whose illustrious career spanned 141 test matches for Ireland and the British and Irish Lions, readily acknowledges.  Now an ambassador for sevens sponsor HSBC, the former Irish captain has watched tournaments, partaken in fitness tests and overseen training sessions -- and he's been impressed with what he's seen.  \"I do look at them in amazement at times,\" O'Driscoll tells CNN. \"That ability to be able to get themselves ramped up to such a particular, high intensity level for a short period of time.\" \"It's an art form to be able to do that. It takes a huge amount of physical capabilities, but it takes a strong mental attitude to do that multiple times over a weekend and sometimes two weekends on the bounce. They're quite remarkable athletes.\" When he speaks of pre-game nerves from his own playing days, O'Driscoll singles out the final of the Celtic and Italian Pro12 in 2013. His club side Leinster had lost the past three finals in a row.  \"It was the most nervous I've ever been because it was just unthinkable to lose another one,\" he says of the contest his team went on to win. \"Sometimes that nervousness and those butterflies get you extra-sharp.\" READ: The long road to rugby stardom For his own part, O'Driscoll says his preparation in the week was key: training at match intensity, not overthinking the task ahead, and not dwelling on the games just gone were all part of his routine.  During a game, he would take advantage of breaks in play: \"I had a non-rugby conversation with the team or just took a breather by myself,\" he says, \"I would have been drained if I stayed on for 80 minutes.\" Some players, however, struggle to achieve this mental clarity.  Jonny Wilkinson, a World Cup winner with England in 2003, has spoken openly about his struggle with anxiety -- his need to visualize every moment of an upcoming game, and to obsessively replay in his head moments from the last.  For Wilkinson, calm and composed on the field, rugby was all-consuming off it. Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videos At an elite level it's something Ryan is familiar with, reasoning that players needs \"other mechanisms to help you until the next game. \"I've always felt there's far more to life than rugby,\" he says.

{"content": "Francis said the church should be ashamed of its treatment of victims, and must move past the historical culture of abuse and secrecy.  Archbishop Charles Scicluna, one of the Vatican's top prosecutors for sex abuse, and Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu will carry out investigations in Osorno over abuse by Chilean priest Father Fernando Karadima and his followers. Karadima was found guilty of child sex abuse by the Vatican in 2011. Victims said Osorno Bishop Juan Barros, who Francis appointed in 2015 over local residents' objections, covered up Karadima's crimes.  Francis had initially discounted the survivors' testimony against Barros, and defended him strenuously for three years, calling accusations against him \"calumny.\" Barros has denied knowing about what he called the \"serious abuses\" of Karadima and has said he never approved or participated in those actions. In the statement Thursday, the Vatican said the Pope will send a personally-written letter to the Chilean church, addressing the issue, and will also meet with Chilean abuse victims in Rome over the weekend.  Francis said one of the church's \"main faults and omissions\" was in \"not knowing how to listen to victims,\" according to the Catholic News Agency.  Because of that, he said, \"partial conclusions were drawn, which lacked crucial elements for a healthy and clear discernment,\" adding he felt \"shame\" over his past actions.  Francis has previously apologized for his own \"grave errors\" in handling the Chilean sex abuse scandal. Worldwide scandal Allegations of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church stretch across multiple countries with large Catholic populations, including Austria, Brazil, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and perhaps most famously, the United States, where children accused more than 4,000 priests of sexual abuse between 1950 and 2002, according to a report compiled by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In May, Australian Archbishop Philip Wilson was convicted of covering up sexual abuse and faces up to two years in prison. He is the highest ranking Catholic official to be convicted of concealing others' crimes. He is due to be sentenced on June 19.  As part of his defense, Wilson's legal team argued that as child sexual abuse was not considered a serious crime in the 1970s, it was not worthy of being reported to authorities.

{"content": "When the 12-time grand slam winner beat a grieving Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4 6-7 (6-8) 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 in gray, wet conditions in Paris that eventually truncated proceedings, it marked a continuation of the momentum Djokovic gained in reaching the semifinals of the Rome Masters last month. Bautista Agut's mother died suddenly late last month.  READ: Who can stop Nadal? Meanwhile, second-seed Alexander Zverev survived for the second straight round by fending off a match point against 26th-seed Damir Dzumhur, 6-2 3-6 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-5. In collecting a maiden top-50 win at a grand slam, it was a hurdle overcome for the much hyped German.  One more win and the 21-year-old reaches a first grand slam quarterfinal.  But women's fourth seed Elina Svitolina was upset by Mihaela Buzarnescu 6-3 7-5.  Make that Dr. Buzarnescu. The Romanian earned a doctorate in Physical Education and Sport largely when she was out of the game with a knee injury. She now sits at 33rd in the rankings after beginning 2017 at 540th, a whopping ascent.   Tough competitor  Bautista Agut is a fine competitor who makes opponents dig in and also took a set off Djokovic in similar weather at the French Open in 2016, when the former world No. 1 conquered Roland Garros to land a fourth straight major.  Djokovic is hoping to return to those heady days following an elbow injury and loss of motivation and the fans in Paris are clearly on his side.  Losing his temper recently in matches has been a good sign for some onlookers -- an indication that the hunger is back.  They would have liked then what Djokovic did in the second-set tiebreak: Missing a forehand at 6-6 when in control of the point, he slammed his racket into the clay several times in disgust.  \"At times in my career, these kind of situations, when I would scream or throw a racket, it would kind of wake me up and help me to just kind of free myself from that pressure that is just building throughout the match, but there are times when it doesn't help,\" Djokovic told reporters. \"So it's really hard to say what's the right thing to do. \"I'm not proud of doing that, to be honest. I don't like doing that. But at times, it happens.\" In this instance it didn't help Djokovic. Bautista Agut not only won the tiebreak but subsequently took a 5-3 lead in the third set. He faltered trying to serve out the set, though.  Djokovic winning a pivotal 31-shot rally at 4-5, 30-30 when his opponent failed to put away a backhand close to the net was perhaps the turning point.   He celebrated when clinching the affair in three hours, 48 minutes before partaking in a warm exchange with the 13th seed.  \"I tried to give him support,\" said Djokovic. \"He has been through some difficult times with his family. That's something that is really unfortunate, and for him to come to this tournament and to be able to play like this, it's quite an effort.\" Said Bautista Agut: \"My life is tennis, no? I'm used to going inside the court and forget about my real life and try to do my work, no? That's the thing I've been doing since a lot of years. And, well, I have to tell you that was not easy to go on court these days...I don't know why I could manage it.\" Last year at the French Open, American Steve Johnson competed weeks after the death of his father.  Djokovic faces another Spaniard on Sunday, Fernando Verdasco, and that probably won't be easy, either.  Though 34, Verdasco -- who upended fourth-seed Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets -- remains hugely fit and knows his way around a clay court. He owns a more than respectable 3-3 record against Djokovic on clay, too.  Ousting Dimitrov was a mild upset, if one at all, given Verdasco's clay pedigree and the Bulgarian's grand slam struggles in Paris, where he spent significant time training in the past.  Zverev escapes  Zverev was extended to five sets Wednesday by Serb Dusan Lajovic but was even closer to exiting against Dzumhur, who was born in Sarajevo shortly after war broke out.  The Bosnian stands 5-foot-9 -- which makes the 26-year-old one of the shorter players on tour -- yet his court coverage, volleying and touch bamboozled the 6-foot-6 Zverev.  Dzumhur, however, crumbled serving at 6-5 in the fourth set, making four unforced errors.  Somehow he regrouped from a 4-2 deficit to lead 5-4 in the fifth. Then with Zverev staring at the match point at 30-40, the German unleashed a huge serve out wide that caught the line.  There was nothing Dzumhur could do.  But on the next point, with time on a backhand close to the net, Dzumhur erred into the net to the relief of the stranded Zverev.  \"That's the point that I will probably remember,\" said Dzumhur, playing in a second straight five-setter himself.  Zverev was pleased with how his body held up but the cumulative effect may well be an issue in the fourth round against either 15th-seed Lucas Pouille of France or Karen Khachanov.  He caught a break when rain meant that match could not be finished, meaning Khachanov and Pouille must resume Saturday with the Russian ahead by two sets.   Sunday's blockbuster in the men's draw just might be 2014 US Open finalist Kei Nishikori meeting two-time French Open semifinalist Dominic Thiem. Nishikori thumped France's Gilles Simon and Thiem advanced in four sets over Italian Matteo Berrettini.  Notching three career wins on clay against Rafael Nadal -- including in Madrid in May to end the Mallorcan's record set streak -- the Austrian is being tipped by many to reach the final from the stacked bottom half.

{"content": "Giuseppe Conte took an oath of loyalty to the Italian constitution in a gilded room in the Quirinal, Italy's presidential palace in Rome, ending three months of political turmoil. But while Conte will nominally hold the most powerful office in Italy, the driving forces in his administration will be the leaders of the two political parties that gained the most votes in an inconclusive election in March: the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. After initially vetoing the choice of finance minister, Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Thursday evening approved a reshuffled lineup. Conte and his Cabinet ministers were sworn in on Friday, with the apparently unsuitable minister -- who had expressed enthusiasm for extricating Italy from the euro -- shifted to the less high-profile role of Europe affairs minister. Conte and his new government will also face a confidence vote in parliament next week. Speaking at the Quirinal on Thursday evening, Conte pledged his new government would \"work intensely to realize the political goals of our agreement\" and \"work with determination to improve the lives of all Italians.\" 'A crucial time for Italy' The country's new populist, euroskeptic government is likely to be met with alarm by other European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who are both eager to push for further EU political and economic integration. President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, offered his congratulations to Conte via a statement published on Twitter, writing that his appointment \"comes at a crucial time for Italy and the entire European Union\" and calling for \"unity and solidarity\" within Europe. \"I strongly believe that our community will only flourish when based on respectful dialogue and loyal cooperation, which I will do my best to ensure,\" he added. The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, also congratulated the new Prime Minister on Twitter, stating that Conte's premiership marks the start of a \"new and important\" legislature. The League has also faced widespread criticism for xenophobic, anti-immigrant policies reminiscent of those forwarded by far-right parties across Europe, including Germany's AfD and France's National Front. League leader Matteo Salvini, who promised during the election campaign to expel half a million illegal immigrants from Italy, has been sworn in as Italy's new interior minister, while Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio is now labor and economic development minister, a key position to fulfill his campaign promise of a universal basic income. Hundreds gathered in Rome and Milan on Friday evening in a rally called by the opposition left-wing Democratic Party, or PD, to defend democracy. Many were also there to protest the new government. Mirko Manico tweeted a photo of demonstrators in Milan's central Piazza della Scala. PD politician Valeria Valente posted pictures of the rally in Rome, writing that she was attending \"to initiate a clear and concrete opposition to the most right-wing government in the history of the Republic.\" The Democratic Party \"was born from anti-fascist and popular cultures that gave Italy freedom and democracy, which is why we are defending the Republic,\" she wrote. A new European crisis? Italy has not had a government since it went to the polls in March, the longest such period in the country's postwar history. For weeks, Di Maio and Salvini were locked in talks with Mattarella and struggled to form a government. During the negotiations, the populists ditched some of their most incendiary campaign vows, such as calling for a referendum on whether Italy should abandon the euro or leave the European Union. Instead they promised a spending and tax-cutting binge that has rattled investors and could contain the seeds of a new European crisis. Tensions have also risen between the two parties and the President, peaking as Di Maio called for Mattarella's impeachment earlier this week following his rejection of Conte's choice of finance minister. Born in the southern region of Puglia, Conte lives in Florence, where he teaches civil law at the University of Florence. When he joined the Five Star Movement during the recent election, he said he supported center-left political ideals. He was mentioned as a potential Public Administration minister in the event the Five Star Movement won a clear majority.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/01/europe/italy-new-government-sworn-in-intl/index.html", "description": "Italy's new prime minister Giuseppe Conte was sworn in Friday afternoon to lead a new populist government, ending almost three months of political uncertainty.", "title": "Giuseppe Conte: New prime minister sworn in to lead populist Italian government", "author": "Livia Borghese and Judith Vonberg, CNN", "date": "2018-06-01 14:09:28"},
{"content": "The demise of Rajoy -- one of Europe's longest-serving political leaders -- paves the way for Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the leader of the main opposition Socialist party, to become Prime Minister.  Friday's vote in Madrid was the culmination of years of corruption allegations against Rajoy's Popular Party (PP). The scandal came to a head last week when a court convicted his former aides of running slush funds to help finance PP election campaigns, prompting S\u00e1nchez to file the confidence motion. The fall of Rajoy's government comes at a time of wider political turmoil in Europe. Two populist parties in Italy have just reached an agreement to form a coalition government after months of wrangling, Brexit dominates UK politics and the European Union must now contend with a looming trade war with the US. Spain's political tumult is born of a long-running corruption scandal coupled with internal division. Although still feeling the effects of the global economic crisis, Spain's economy is performing better than that of Italy, and anti-European sentiment played no part in its change of government.  Nonetheless, S\u00e1nchez, leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), faces significant challenges as he assumes office. Spain was riven last year by the Catalan independence crisis, which remains unresolved. Rajoy's fate was sealed on Thursday after the Socialists secured support for the no-confidence motion from a number of smaller parties in Parliament, including the Basque Nationalist Party.  In total, 180 of the chamber's 350 lawmakers voted in support of the motion, a clear majority. There were 169 votes against and one abstention. It was the first time in Spain's post-1977 democracy that a Spanish Prime Minister has fallen in this way. Ana Pastor, President of the lower house of the Spanish Parliament, announced that S\u00e1nchez has \"the trust of the Parliament\" and so becomes the new Prime Minister of Spain. In line with the constitution, she was to inform Spain's King Felipe II on Friday afternoon. S\u00e1nchez received a standing ovation, with parliamentarians shouting: \"Yes, it can be done.\" Rajoy shook hands with S\u00e1nchez, his 46-year-old successor, to congratulate him. Speaking shortly before the vote, Rajoy said he had been proud to serve his country. \"It has been an honor to leave a better Spain than I found,\" he said. \"I wish my substitute could say the same when his day comes, for the good of Spain.\" S\u00e1nchez -- a pro-European economics professor who was a keen basketball player in his youth -- previously said that he would call for snap elections should he become Prime Minister. He is expected to take office and nominate his Cabinet next week. Posting on Twitter, S\u00e1nchez promised a fresh start for the country. \"Spain starts a new page. A period to recover the dignity of its institutions. From responsibility, dialogue and consensus, it is time to work for equality, to build a country that does not leave anyone behind,\" he said. Separatist parties S\u00e1nchez became PSOE leader in 2014, when the photogenic then-42-year-old was thought of as the new young and \"handsome\" face of politics. But in 2016 his party performed poorly in elections and was unable to assemble a coalition government to keep Rajoy out of power. That didn't sit well with some people in his party and in October of that year he resigned under pressure. He then presented himself as a candidate for the primaries and won comfortably in 2017, proof that he remained popular with socialists in Spain. However, critics have accused him of wanting to become Prime Minister whatever the price.  S\u00e1nchez needed the support of fringe and pro-independence parties, as well as the anti-austerity Podemos party, to push the confidence motion through Parliament. And, since his own party holds only 84 seats, S\u00e1nchez will need to keep those parties, with their differing agendas, on his side in order to pass any legislation.  He has previously said he would stick to the budget recently passed by Rajoy's government and continue to enact socioeconomic reforms. Nathan Jones, a Spanish politics expert at Britain's Nottingham Trent University, said the ousting of Rajoy's government represented another step into the unknown for Spain. \"Thus far, few of the parties who backed the vote of no confidence in Rajoy have indicated that they will support S\u00e1nchez's government, increasing the probability of a snap general election, the third since 2015, having to be called,\" he said.  \"Support for S\u00e1nchez from parties other than Podemos may yet still emerge; however, significant divisions remain between many of the political parties, thus establishing a stable government is far from certain.\" Rajoy: 'A better Spain' Rajoy, who came to office in 2011, had effectively conceded defeat ahead of the vote, congratulating S\u00e1nchez on his expected win in a brief address to Parliament. \"In light of what we all know, I presume that the vote of no confidence will go ahead, and Pedro S\u00e1nchez will become the Prime Minister and I want to be the first to congratulate him,\" Rajoy said, visibly moved as he gave what was to be his last address as Spain's leader. \"I will accept the result of the vote as the democrat I am, but I cannot agree with what has been done.\" Rajoy's party has been plagued with corruption allegations for years. Rajoy himself has faced the humiliation of testifying in cases against PP members, though he has not been among the accused. The confidence motion was filed by S\u00e1nchez after a court convicted Rajoy's former aides of running slush funds to help finance Popular Party election campaigns. The court also questioned the credibility of Rajoy's testimony during the proceedings. It was the first time in Spain that a party had been convicted and fined on corruption-related charges. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, tweeted his congratulations to S\u00e1nchez. \"I trust that the Spanish government will continue contributing in a constructive way for a Europe that is stronger, more united and fairer,\" he said, adding that Spain \"plays a very important role\" in the European project.  European Council President Donald Tusk also offered his congratulations, saying S\u00e1nchez's appointment came at a \"challenging time\" for the continent. \"European unity is now more needed than ever,\" he said in a statement.  The Party of European Socialists (PES), made up of parties from across the European Union, welcomed S\u00e1nchez's election, saying his government would form a \"credible alternative to a conservative government hounded by corruption.\" PES President Sergei Stanishev described S\u00e1nchez as \"a progressive and honest pro-European\" who would \"shift away from the austerity policies of the past years in his country.\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/01/europe/spain-rajoy-confidence-vote-sanchez-intl/index.html", "description": "Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday became the first leader in Spain's modern democracy to lose a vote of no confidence in Parliament.

She said she was aware the government has difficult tasks ahead, but she's optimistic about the possibility of change. \"Now we have five years in government,\" she said. \"Rome was not built in a day.\" The celebrations coincided with Italy's Republic Day, which marks the founding of the Italian republic. Planes flew over Rome, trailing smoke in red, white and green, the colors of the Italian flag. \"I am happy,\" said Gabriella Jezler, a nurse from Florence. \"I hope things will change. We want more respect as citizens and more respect of our country on a European level.\" The Five Star Movement, an anti-globalist and euroskeptic party, is half the alliance now governing Italy, along with the far-right League. The new, unorthodox government was sworn in Friday following months of political turmoil. The country had been without a government since it went to the polls in March, the longest such period in the country's postwar history. Italian President Sergio Mattarella approved the new government Thursday, cementing Five Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio, a 31-year-old college dropout, as one of the deputy prime ministers who will be a driving force in the government. Though the new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte -- a political novice -- is prime minister, his power will be checked by his deputies, the leaders of the two largest parties that emerged from the inconclusive March 4 ballot. The other deputy prime minister, 45-year-old Matteo Salvini, is the leader of the League party, and has promised to expel half a million illegal immigrants from Italy. He's also shared anti-immigrant memes on social media. Salvini will serve as the new interior minister as well.

{"content": "But when the world-famous duo landed in the same quarter of the draw at this year's French Open, there was no guarantee they would clash in the fourth round.  Williams was playing her first grand slam in 16 months and only her third tournament of 2018 after giving birth to daughter Olympia in September, while Sharapova dealt with an arm injury this year and still sought top form after returning from a drug suspension in April 2017.  Yet the pair will face off indeed for the 22nd time after both won Saturday at Roland Garros.  \"We are both on a comeback for two totally different reasons, and she's been on her journey for over a year and I just started mine a couple months ago,\" said Williams. \"So it's just something new and different.\"  Struggling somewhat in the opening two rounds, both put in their best performances of the fortnight on a sunny, warm day in Paris that was a complete contrast to Friday's wet, heavy conditions.  On paper, anyway, they were upset victories.  Williams -- her ranking down to 451st due to a lack of matches since winning the 2017 Australian Open in the early stages of pregnancy -- defeated 11th-seed Julia Goerges 6-3 6-4 Saturday evening. The 23-time grand slam champ faced a mere one break point and tallied 85% of her first-serve points.  \"I feel like every match I play I'm getting better and I'm playing tougher opponents and I'm hanging in there, and I feel like it's going to hopefully keep going,\" said Williams.  Sharapova thumped sixth-seed Karolina Pliskova 6-2 6-1 in the afternoon, winning nearly 60% of her return points versus last year's women's ace leader and Roland Garros semifinalist.   Monday, though, comes the hard part for 28th-seed Sharapova, no doubt the toughest challenge of her career -- trying to beat Williams.  Lopsided record  Sharapova trails the series 19-2 and last overcame the American in 2004.  Sixteen straight sets have gone against her, including in the quarterfinals at the 2016 Australian Open, Sharapova's last match prior to serving the ban for taking meldonium.  \"I think any time you play against Serena you know what you're up against,\" the five-time grand slam winner told reporters. \"You know the challenge that is upon you.  \"Despite the record that I have against her, I always look forward to coming out on the court and competing against the best player.\" They wouldn't be considered pals but Sharapova admitted to being \"inspired\" by her on-court tormentor. Their path to stardom from humble beginnings is also inspiring, according to Sharapova.  Born in Siberia, Russia, Sharapova moved to the US aged six to chase her tennis dream. Williams and older sister Venus grew up in Compton in the 1980s at a time when gang warfare was not uncommon in the Los Angeles suburb.  Williams, however, wasn't inspired by Sharapova's autobiography, 'Unstoppable: My Life So Far,' published last year.  'Hearsay book' In the book, Sharapova said Williams was devastated after losing their final at Wimbledon in 2004, a win that truly put the Russian on the tennis map. She described hearing \"guttural sobs\" in the locker room.   \"I think Serena hated me for being the skinny kid who beat her, against all odds, at Wimbledon,\" wrote Sharapova.  And, hypothesized Sharapova, it's the reason why Williams wracked up that 19-2 record against her. But Williams hit back.  \"I think the book was 100% hearsay, at least all the stuff I read and the quotes that I read, which was a little bit disappointing,\" said Williams. \"I have cried in the locker room many times after a loss, and that's what I have seen a lot of people do. I think it's normal. I think if anything, it shows the passion and the desire and the will that you have to want to go out there and do the best. \"I think what happens there should definitely maybe stay there, and not necessarily talk about it in a not so positive way in a book,\" added Williams.  Williams, though, said she harbored no \"negative feelings\" towards Sharapova.  Twice Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova joined her Czech Fed Cup teammate Pliskova on the sidelines, losing to Anett Kontaveit 7-6 (8-6) 7-6 (7-4) in a match originally scheduled for Friday.  Kvitova entered the French Open as a contender after winning clay titles in Prague and Madrid and holding a 13-match winning streak. A year ago in Paris, she made her return to tennis after being attacked in her home and suffering nerve damage to her left, playing hand.  The 25th-seeded Kontaveit had a fruitful clay swing -- beating Venus Williams twice -- herself and a breakthrough win at a grand slam had been coming after several near misses.   \"Of course, I'm pretty sad, but, on the other hand, I'm very happy about everything in the life,\" said Kvitova.  Rafael Nadal, meanwhile, achieved yet another milestone on clay.  When the Spaniard again crushed France's Richard Gasquet, 6-3 6-2 6-2 -- he is now 16-0 against his friend -- he claimed a 34th straight set at Roland Garros to eclipse his previous best of 32.  Nadal is now not far behind Bjorn Borg's record of 41 set from 1979-81.  German next for Nadal He will be expected to win in straight sets again Monday when he takes on the rising, but little known, German Maximilian Marterer. The two other highest seeds in Nadal's half, Marin Cilic and Juan Martin del Potro, didn't conceded a set, either, in dispatching Steve Johnson and Albert Ramos Vinolas, respectively.  Gasquet was one of four French men to depart, leaving none in the round of 16 for the first time since 2007. Gael Monfils -- ill all week -- squandered four match points against Belgium's David Goffin in his 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 4-6 7-5 6-3 reverse.  READ: Who can stop Nadal? Camila Giorgi twice couldn't serve out proceedings against US Open winner Sloane Stephens, with the American advancing 4-6 6-1 8-6.  Based on the first three rounds, 2016 winner Garbine Muguruza might be the player to beat in the women's draw. A Spanish double in the final weekend, perhaps?  Having downed fellow French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in her opener, Muguruza eased past former finalist Sam Stosur 6-0 6-2.  Simona Halep, like Kvitova, was pushed back to Saturday because of the rain. The world No. 1 topped Andrea Petkovic 7-5 6-0 in a repeat of their 2014 semifinal.  Visit CNN.com/tennis for more news, features and videos Halep went on to lose a thrilling final to Sharapova and is still bidding for a first major, coming close again 12 months ago and at January's Australian Open.

{"content": "This week the third- and fourth-largest economies in the eurozone -- Italy and Spain -- experienced political earthquakes. Italy will now have a government of insurgents with little faith in the \"European project.\" Spain will have an odd coalition united only in ousting the unpopular conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Spanish voters likely face their third election in three years. Back in 2012, Europe had its \"PIGS\" problem (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain): toxic banks, overwhelming debt and chronic budget deficits. Now it has the \"PHIGS\" of 2018: Poland, Hungary, Italy, Greece and Spain.  Today the challenges are more complex and diverse -- but they have common roots in a growing popular disenchantment with the political mainstream. And the cast of characters is different. A rude awakening Italy is the most immediate threat to the European Union. In elections on March 4, Italians mutinied and handed victory to two parties that railed against the establishment both in Rome and in Brussels -- the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League.  They drew support from very different constituencies. The M5S is unashamedly populist, promising poorer Italians a better deal. The League's supporters are better off, but equally hostile to immigration and the power of the EU.  Earlier this week, President Sergio Mattarella nixed their nomination of a prominent euroskeptic as Finance Minister. All hell broke loose, and there were mutterings about impeaching Mattarella. But by the end of the week, the M5S and the League had their way as the President accepted a revised cabinet lineup.   Europe is about to get a rude awakening. But Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, isn't rolling over -- saying that Italy needs \"more work, less corruption, seriousness.\"  The financial markets are relieved Italy has a government after nearly 90 days without, but apprehensive about what comes next. The recipes advanced by M5S and the League combine higher public spending and tax cuts -- a high-risk strategy in a country sitting on a debt pile of 2.1 trillion euros and an inflexible labor market. By contrast, Spain has made huge progress since being on life support six years ago, when its banks were sinking and ratings agencies valued its debt at a notch above junk, on a par with Azerbaijan. Its economy is growing at a healthy tick; unemployment is down (though still high); its credit rating is restored. And Spaniards are enthusiastically pro-Europe. So why worry? Because politics in Spain -- long dominated by the conservative Popular Party (PP) and the Socialists -- has splintered. Not only is there separatism in Catalonia but two parties, Podemos and Ciudadanos, have emerged to challenge the old duopoly. Podemos has the same sort of populist roots as M5S (though its prescriptions are very different); Ciudadanos rails against endemic corruption. Spain had two elections in 2016. Both delivered stalemate; eventually Mariano Rajoy cobbled together a minority government. But corruption convictions against senior PP members last week led to a no-confidence motion in Parliament. Now Spain has a Socialist Prime Minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, whose party holds just 84 of the 350 parliamentary seats. The other PHIGS What of the other PHIGS? Greece has known nothing other than crisis for nearly a decade. In 2012, an ignominious exit from the eurozone looked almost inevitable.  Now Greece runs a budget surplus, but its cumulative debt is 180% of its gross domestic product (Italy's is 133%.) On August 20, it exits the intensive care administered by the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, but Europe has to decide what sort of debt relief it will offer on the $280 billion Athens still owes.  Germany and others are not in charitable mood, and there's no guarantee of an agreement that will allow Greece to sustain its debt load when EU finance ministers hold a make-or-break meeting later this month.  Then there are Poland and Hungary. They are financially in good shape but at war with Brussels on everything from immigration and the independence of the judiciary to freedom of the press and \"democratic values.\"  They have right-wing populist governments that might be charitably described as \"semi-detached\" from the EU. Both rejected EU plans for migrant quotas to share the burden of the influx arriving across the Mediterranean, prompting the European Commission to bring legal action.   Viktor Orban, who dominates Hungarian politics as Prime Minister (he won his third term in April) and leader of the governing Fidesz party, promotes what he calls an \"illiberal\" alternative to European consensus. Poland, meanwhile, has sided with the Trump administration against its European partners on subjects as varied as Iran sanctions and Russian gas pipelines to Europe. Warsaw's measures to restrict the independence of the judiciary have brought censure from Brussels. To try to rein in these wayward members, European officials are floating the prospect of cuts in the generous financial support given to the former Communist states that joined the EU in the 1990s. The EU budget will take a hit when the UK leaves; Poland (which gets about one-tenth of the EU budget) and Hungary may pay the price. And finally of course, on the EU's menu of unsolved issues, the terms for Brexit are far from concluded, despite more than a year of negotiations and the looming deadline of March 2019.  Once Britain leaves, Germany and France will once again be the motors of Europe, as they were when the original Common Market was formed. There were hopes that a Macron-Merkel axis would lead the European Union to the sunlit uplands of a new era, but the French President's ambitions to deepen integration are not matched by the German Chancellor's caution. Merkel has been chastened by the eruption of German populism in the shape of the Alternative for Germany, the far-right anti-immigrant party that is now the official opposition in the German parliament. As if Macron and Merkel don't have enough on their hands, the EU also has to deal with the headache of an incipient trade war with the US. In 1954 one of Merkel's predecessors, Konrad Adenauer, set out lofty goals. \"The unity of Europe was the dream of a few. It became the hope of many. Today it has become a necessity for all of us,\" he said. In its many iterations since, the European project has survived crisis after crisis. Odds are it will stumble through these multiple challenges. But if the horizon looked dark in 2012, it's positively thunderous now.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/02/europe/europe-next-crisis-phigs-lister-intl/index.html", "description": "In 2012, Europe's problems centered around toxic banks, overwhelming debt and budget deficits.

{"content": "Pope Francis said in a statement that Greg O'Kelly, the current Bishop of Port Pirie, in the state of South Australia, would temporarily replace Philip Wilson, the Archbishop of Adelaide, who stepped aside after being convicted of covering up abuses last month. Wilson is the highest ranking Catholic official to be convicted of covering up sexual abuse, part of a global scandal that has dogged the Vatican for decades. The 67-year-old was found guilty of having concealed the abuse of altar boys in the 1970s by a pedophile priest colleague, James Fletcher, when he was an assistant parish priest in the state of New South Wales.   Archbishop Wilson stepped down on May 23, a day after he was convicted at the Newcastle Local Court in New South Wales.  As part of his defense, Wilson's legal team argued that because child sexual abuse was not considered a serious crime in the 1970s, it was not worthy of being reported to authorities, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). At the time, Wilson released a statement that said, \"If at any point in time it becomes necessary or appropriate for me to take more formal steps, including by resigning as archbishop, then I will do so.\" Wilson faces a maximum penalty of two years in prison. Letter asks families to 'pray for him'  Following the conviction, a letter from Wilson was sent to Catholic schools across South Australia asking families to \"pray\" for him, according to the ABC. In the letter, Wilson said that, \"while the legal process runs its course, I want to assure the Catholic faithful in the Archdiocese of my continued prayers and best wishes and assure everyone that the affairs of the Archdiocese will be appropriately managed in my absence.\" However some parents of schoolchildren who received the letter criticized the Archbishop's apparent lack of remorse for his crime and lack of empathy for victims of sexual abuse.  Historical abuse Archbishop Wilson was a junior priest when Fletcher, a Catholic Priest based in the Hunter Valley of NSW, abused altar boys.  Wilson was charged in 2015, accused of failing to report Fletcher's abuse to police. Fletcher died in prison in 2006, a year after being found guilty of eight counts of child abuse and sentenced to 10 years. Speaking to reporters outside the Newcastle Court last week, one of Fletcher's victims praised the Archbishop's conviction. Former altar boy Peter Creigh, who waived his right to a non-publication order on his name, said, \"It's a decision that will hopefully unravel the hypocrisy, the deceit, and the abuse of power and trust that the Church has displayed. And I say that on behalf of all victims, because it is a very, very significant day.\" Creigh told the court he had described the abuse to Wilson in detail five years after it took place, the ABC reported. Widespread claims Allegations of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church stretch across multiple countries with large Catholic populations, including Austria, Brazil, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United States, where children accused more than 4,000 priests of sexual abuse between 1950 and 2002, according to a report compiled by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Last month, Vatican Treasurer Cardinal George Pell faced his first appearance at an Australian higher court after a Melbourne magistrate ordered him to stand trial on multiple charges of historical sexual abuse. Pell is the most senior figure in the Catholic Church to face criminal charges for alleged sexual assault. He is on leave from the Vatican while he contests the claims. The charges relate to claims of historical sexual abuse spanning three decades, and include events that allegedly took place at a swimming pool in rural Victoria in the 1970s and at St Patrick's Cathedral during the 1990s, when Pell served as Archbishop of Melbourne.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/03/australia/australian-archbishop-philip-wilson-replacement-intl/index.html", "description": "The Vatican has appointed a temporary replacement for the Archdiocese of Adelaide after Australian Archbishop Philip Wilson was convicted of concealing child sex abuse.", "title": "Vatican replaces archbishop convicted of concealing child sex abuse", "author": "Delia Gallagher and Sheena McKenzie, CNN ", "date": "2018-06-03 11:58:31"},
{"content": "It was the 25-year-old's second victory of the season having taken top honors in Madrid last month.   In Spain, the Briton rode Explosion W to victory but, with that horse resting back home, Maher put his faith in another nine-year-old gelding, Winning Good.  \"I'm absolutely delighted,\" he said. \"My horse, Winning Good, is only nine-years-old so he's young for this level. He gave me everything today. He was a bit tired in the jump-off which really tested his ability. I'm very lucky right now with the horses I have to ride. They are young and have bright futures.'' The event in the South of France was making its debut on the Longines Global Champions Tour.  Organized by the daughter of the late Greek shipping magnet Aristotle Onnasis, the Longines Athina Onassis Horse Show was established in 2014 and the red carpet was rolled out as VIPs and beautifully dressed guests flocked to the sixth event of the 2018 Global Champions season. Just a short stroll from the turquoise waters of the famous Pampelonne Beach, under blue skies the crowd were treated to an exciting finale to the show. Of the 34 who qualified for the \u20ac300,000 Grand Prix, seven riders made it through to the jump-off against the clock.  First into the sand arena was the European Champion and Olympic Silver Medalist, Peder Fredricson. Riding Hasson WL he put the pressure on the remaining riders with a smooth clear.  Following the Swedish rider, poles fell for American Lillie Keenan and Belgium's Olivier Philippaerts and Niels Bruynseels before Australia's Edwina Tops-Alexander, on board her LGCT Miami Beach-winning horse, California, put in a faster clear to move into pole position.  Maher, the penultimate rider to enter the ring, would need to take a risk if he was to better her time. Turning tightly he took a stride out into the double of fences across the center of the arena, and his bravery was rewarded as he bettered the Australian's time by over a second.  The final rider, Carlos Lopez, from Colombia, split the pair to finish second to record a career best finish in an LGCT Grand Prix.  With the top five riders in the overall LGCT rankings all competing in St Tropez, the class had the potential to shake up the overall season rankings. READ: The 62-year-old eying the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Leader, Scott Brash, earlier clocked up 12 penalties on his gelding, Hello Mr President, so failed to qualify for the Grand Prix.  His absence means he drops to third place with both Tops-Alexander and Maher moving above him. Australia's Tops-Alexander leads with 154 points, 11 clear of Maher on 143 with nine events remaining in 2018.  Global Champions League Earlier in the day, Shanghai Swans recorded a comfortable victory in the Global Champions League team competition. Germany's Daniel Deusser and Brazil's Pedro Veniss were the only duo to record four clear rounds across the two-day team event.  Italian course designer Uliano Vetzzani took no prisoners in building Saturday's final round. With most of the fences up to the 1m 55cm maximum height and in the small purpose-built arena, poles fell as the very best were tested.  Of the 62 starters, only 12 riders jumped clear and the enthusiastic crowd were treated to a master class from the winning team.  Veniss, riding his powerful chestnut stallion Quabri de L'Isle, was the first of the pair to make the course look easy. His clear round gave German Olympic bronze medalist, Deusser, an eight fault, or two pole, buffer ahead of his round.  A buffer that wasn't needed as he, like Viness, recorded a smooth clear on Tobago Z to claim the top spot on the podium.  Deusser said he didn't feel any nerves as he entered the arena as the last rider to go. \"With Pedro jumping clear, the pressure was off me,\" he said. \"Nevertheless I was very confident in my horse after he jumped so well in the first round yesterday. The fences were big enough for the size of the arena and they came very fast. I can see why the course caused so much trouble.'' The top 16-ranked teams this season will qualify for the inaugural Global Champions Play Offs in Prague in December, which has a record prize pot of $10m, including $3m for the winning team.   Veniss added: \"Our goal for this season is to qualify for Prague so we will keep fighting for that. My horse was amazing today and it's a pleasure to ride alongside Daniel.\" League leaders, London Knights, moved up from fifth place overnight to claim second. The pair of Maher and Belgium's Olivier Philippaerts finished on eight faults, or two poles down, with with home favourite Roger-Yves Bost and Colombia's Carlos Lopez in third for Chantilly Pegasus.  Having won in both Shanghai and Madrid, London Knights second-place finish sees them extend their lead at the top of the table after the sixth leg of the championship. Reigning league champions, Valkenswaard United, remain in second, while the win in St Tropez for Shangahi Swans moves them up to third place on the overall league leaderboard.

{"content": "S\u00e1nchez, who leads the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, took the oath of office before King Felipe VI at the Zarzuela Palace near Madrid. He was the first Spanish Prime Minister to be sworn in without a Bible or crucifix, according to his party. \"I promise by my conscience and honor to faithfully fulfill the obligations of the office of President of the Government with loyalty to the King, and to keep and enforce the Constitution as the fundamental norm of the State,\" S\u00e1nchez said. Rajoy was present at the ceremony, shook S\u00e1nchez's hand and wished him good luck. The 46-year-old politician faces significant challenges as he assumes office. Spain was riven last year by the Catalan independence crisis, which remains unresolved, and many Spaniards continue to feel the effects of the global economic crisis. S\u00e1nchez -- a pro-European economics professor who was a keen basketball player in his youth -- previously said he would call for snap elections should he become Prime Minister. S\u00e1nchez will work on his Cabinet this weekend, and it will be announced at some point next week, his party said. His Socialists secured support for the no-confidence motion from a number of other parties in parliament, including the anti-austerity Podemos, Catalan pro-independence parties and the Basque Nationalist Party.  Since his own party holds only 84 seats in the 350-seat chamber, S\u00e1nchez will need to keep those parties, with their differing agendas, on his side in order to pass any legislation.  Europe is on the verge of a big new crisis Catalan leader: 'Let's talk' Catalonia's separatist President Quim Torra called Saturday for dialogue with S\u00e1nchez as members of the Catalan regional executive were sworn in in Barcelona, ending seven months of direct rule by Madrid. \"President Pedro S\u00e1nchez: Let's talk and let's meet,\" Torra said. \"Let's take risks, from your side and our side. Let's sit at the same table and negotiate from government to government. This situation we are experiencing can't go on any longer.\" Catalonia's independence drive plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in decades. Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia after the regional parliament unilaterally declared independence in October, thereby stripping the autonomous region of many of its administrative powers.  Some of the Cabinet members wore yellow at their swearing-in ceremony to recall Catalan separatists who remain in prison or in self-imposed exile over their role in the independence bid. Among those is Carles Puigdemont, the former president of Catalonia, who is currently in Germany. 'Spain starts a new page' Posting Friday on Twitter, S\u00e1nchez promised a fresh start for the country. \"Spain starts a new page. A period to recover the dignity of its institutions. From responsibility, dialogue and consensus, it is time to work for equality, to build a country that does not leave anyone behind,\" he said. Rajoy had been in power since 2011 as the head of the Popular Party. On Friday, he became the first leader in Spain's modern democracy to lose a no-confidence vote in parliament. The Socialists tweeted that it was a \"great day for democracy\" and that the party would \"work responsibly to give back our country the dignity it deserves.\" Rajoy's party has been plagued with corruption allegations for years. Rajoy has faced the humiliation of testifying in cases against its members, though he has not been among the accused. The confidence motion was filed by S\u00e1nchez after a court convicted Rajoy's former aides of running slush funds to help finance Popular Party election campaigns. The court also questioned the credibility of Rajoy's testimony during the proceedings. It was the first time in Spain that a party had been convicted and fined on corruption-related charges.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/02/europe/spain-swears-in-prime-minister-sanchez-intl/index.html", "description": "The 46-year-old politician promised a fresh start for his country a day after ousting scandal-hit political rival Mariano Rajoy in a no-confidence vote.", "title": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez sworn in as Spain's new Prime Minister", "author": "Laura Smith-Spark and Laura Perez Maestro, CNN", "date": "2018-06-02 09:43:59"},
{"content": "Although the Frenchwoman is now covering her 32nd French Open, she says working at Roland Garros in Paris is still a privilege. \"What is so special here at Roland Garros is of course the clay and the courts,\" Dubreuil told CNN.  \"It is beautiful, especially so late in the day with the sun, we have amazing shadows, and there is also the clay flying in the air,\" said Dubreuil, who works for the French Tennis Federation and the tournament's official website. Chris Evert Dubreuil first fell in love with photography when her uncle, who was an amateur photographer, gave her a camera when she was 11 years old. Dubreuil, a keen tennis player from the age of six, was hooked, and told her parents she wanted to become a tennis photographer. If it hadn't been for 18-time grand slam singles winner Chris Evert, Dubreuil's dream may never have come true. In 1987, when Dubreuil was 16, she went to Roland Garros for the first time and she took pictures of Evert, who had been playing on Court One..  \"After a few days, I tried to get an autograph,\" she said. \"I got it and after awhile, Chrissie gave me her phone number and I was able to call her at home and she gave me tickets to Wimbledon and to the US Open. And that's how it started.\" READ: Rafael Nadal's secret weapon: the sea School Although she was still in school, Dubreuil started to go to tournaments, funding her travels by selling pictures she took with her first camera, a Minolta X-300, of players including Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi and Boris Becker, for 10 francs (\u20ac1.50) each to fans.  \"At the same time as I was traveling a little bit and shooting tennis, I was still at school,\" she said. \"I remember in 1989, Chris Evert was playing in Wimbledon and I was still trying to graduate, I had some exams and I was in Wimbledon. \"So I called my mum, and she said 'You have to come back because you have to do exams' and I said 'I'm sorry, Mum, but Air France is on strike, I cannot come back.' So I didn't come back and a few months later, my dream came true when I started to work at Tennis Magazine, the French one.\" READ: Why Nadal is so tough to beat on clay READ: Serena's stunning comeback Rafael Nadal In 2003, Dubreuil left Tennis Magazine to go freelance, mostly covering tennis. During her long career, Dubreuil has come to know some of the game's top players very well.  \"I remember when Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo started, she was 11 years old the first time I shot her. And I followed her all her career,\" she said about the former Wimbledon winner from France. One of her favorite players to photograph is Rafael Nadal, the 10-time French Open winner from Spain.  \"He is very photogenic, for me he is the one to photograph,\" she said. \"Each time he is hitting the ball, you have a good picture ... it is always a pleasure to shoot Rafa.\" Access As one of five official photographers working for the website of the French Open, Dubreuil has better access than normal press photographers, which allows her to shoot more intimate pictures.  For example, she is allowed to take pictures of the players when they are waiting in the hallways underneath the two main show courts a few minutes before entering the court. \"We are very lucky,\" she said. \"We have more opportunity to be behind the scenes, you can cover a few areas, like the locker rooms.\" Shadows A special time to photograph the action at Roland Garros is at around 6 pm, when the shadows start falling over the court.  \"After 7 pm, you have half of the court in the dark and the player can be in the sun with a lovely shadow,\" she said. \"I have done a lot of good pictures there, especially of Rafa but also Serena Williams.\"  During this year's French Open, Dubreuil is keeping an eye on the next generation of tennis stars. \"We have a lot of new players, the next generation is very exciting,\" she said. \"I think we are coming at the end of a big story with Rafa and Roger ... the new ones are coming, and I am very excited to discover these guys.\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/04/sport/corinne-dubreuil-roland-garros-photographer-french-open-spt/index.html", "description": "Corinne Dubreuil is one of the best tennis photographers in the world -- and she's had a front row seat to history for decades.", "title": "French Open 2018: Photographer to the tennis stars", "author": "Danielle Rossingh and Heidi Berger", "date": "2018-06-04 11:35:32"},
{"content": "Cumberbatch, 41, reportedly jumped out of his Uber cab to help a cyclist from the food delivery company Deliveroo, who was being attacked by a group of would-be muggers in central London. Deliveroo thanked Cumberbatch in a tweet Saturday, describing his actions as brave.  \"Deliveroo riders are heroes -- their safety is our priority and any violence against them is totally unacceptable,\" the delivery company said  In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police said a cyclist in his 20s was making a delivery when four men pounced on him and punched him in the face in an attempt to take his bike.  Cumberbatch, who was in a nearby cab with his wife, Sophie Hunter, rushed to the cyclist's rescue, pulling the attackers away and shouting \"leave him alone,\" British newspaper the Sun reported on Saturday. The incident reportedly happened in November, but only came to light recently, according to the paper. CNN could not independently verify the incident or whether Cumberbatch was involved because police did not identify the people involved. Attempts to reach Cumberbatch and Uber were unsuccessful.  The group fled without stealing anything, and the cyclist did not require hospital treatment, police said about the incident.  \"The cyclist was lucky, Benedict's a superhero,\" his Uber driver Manuel Dias told the paper.  \"Benedict was courageous, brave and selfless. If he hadn't stepped in the cyclist could have been seriously injured,\" Dias added of the actor who plays Sherlock Holmes in the long-running BBC TV series.

{"content": "But marathon woman Caroline Wozniacki -- she finished the New York City Marathon in 2014 -- trailed Daria Kasatkina 7-6 (7-5) 3-3 when darkness halted proceedings at around 9:20 p.m. Paris time.  For the third consecutive round, Zverev rallied from a 2-1 deficit in sets and this time it came against a friend from his junior days, Karen Khachanov.  It wasn't as dramatic as his previous tussle when the second seed saved a match point against Damir Dzhumhur, but the 21-year-old found himself in trouble in the fourth set Sunday prior to defeating the unseeded Russian 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 2-6 6-3 6-3.  He was joined in the men's quarterfinals by Dominic Thiem, his next opponent, and the rejuvenated Novak Djokovic.  At 2-2 in the fourth, Zverev saved two break points and then broke for 4-2 after Khachanov led 40-15 on serve.  When the match ended on court Suzanne-Lenglen, Zverev sunk to his knees with arms outstretched.  Asked later about finally achieving the last eight at a major -- he has won three Masters titles and makes regular appearances in quarterfinals at ATP events -- Zverev offered up a mixture of sarcasm and humor, which is nothing new.   \"I'm very pi**ed off about it,\" he smiled. \"I want to be home right now.  \"I'm happy. But this is not the end. This is the quarterfinals.\" Vows to be ready Zverev has shown his mental toughness and physical stamina in reversing the deficits in Paris.  And in typical Zverev style, he vowed to be \"ready\" for his crunch clash with Thiem.  \"I'm in the quarterfinals of a grand slam. If you're mentally fatigued, then something is wrong with you,\" said Zverev, the youngest men's quarterfinalist at the French Open since Juan Martin del Potro in 2009. \"Physically, obviously it's not easy to play back to back to back five-set matches, but I will manage it somehow.  \"I will make sure to be ready in two days' time.\" Thiem has been even more impressive considering the opponents he encountered.  He overcame the dangerous Stefanos Tsitsipas in four sets in the second round, for example, and passed an even more difficult test Sunday from Kei Nishikori.    The Austrian blew the Monte Carlo finalist away in the first two sets, lost the third, but came through 6-2 6-0 5-7 6-4 to land in a third consecutive Roland Garros quarterfinal.  Thiem stumbled in the Madrid Masters final to Zverev last month, though given the stage, their respective forms and the latter's time spent on court, the seventh seed goes in as favorite.  \"I think it's the matchup most of the fans in Germany and Austria were hoping for when they saw the draw,\" said Thiem.  Most neutrals, too.  'Great step' Thiem is keen to progress even further and to a maiden French Open final after being convincingly knocked out in the semifinals the previous two seasons by Djokovic and Sunday's birthday boy Rafael Nadal.  \"I think for me it's time to move on to make a great step, because I'm turning 25\" in September, said Thiem. \"I'm not that young anymore. That's (Zverev's) part. He's only 21.\" Wozniacki is a tour veteran at 27 and to her delight, won't ever be asked again when she'll win a first major after breaking through at the Australian Open in January. Hard courts certainly are to the world No. 2's liking, with clay bringing less success. Wozniacki did however make the quarterfinals last year in Paris prior to losing to the eventual champion Jelena Ostapenko. Kasatkina doesn't possess Ostapenko's power but she owns a varied game with her share of power and spin.  The bubbly 21-year-old made the biggest final of her career in Indian Wells in March, beating Wozniacki en route. Sunday evening she rallied from 5-3 down in the first set, which lasted 68 minutes.  Both players wanted play suspended as light faded just after 9 p.m. but were told to continue by tournament officials, to the crowd's delight. Twenty more minutes elapsed before the duo went off.   Djokovic eased past Fernando Verdasco 6-3 6-4 6-2, although the early stages on Philippe-Chatrier court suggested a lengthy battle. The first three games lasted close to 30 minutes.  The 12-time grand slam winner's next challenger isn't David Goffin but rather Marco Cecchinato, who upset the ailing eighth-seed 7-5 4-6 6-0 6-3 after losing to the Belgian last month.  On Saturday, Goffin saved four match points to complete a draining victory over Gael Monfils.  Cecchinato -- who trailed by two sets in his opener -- has enjoyed quite the rise since the end of April, when he won the Budapest title as a lucky loser to help his ranking rise to its current 72nd.  Two years ago Cecchinato was cleared of match fixing after initially being given an 18-month ban by Italy's tennis federation.  Grand slam quarterfinal sweep Americans Madison Keys and Sloane Stephens have now advanced to the quarterfinals at all four majors after their comfortable wins over Mihaela Buzarnescu and Anett Kontaveit, respectively.  Keys prevailed 6-1 6-4 and hasn't dropped a set on the surface she finds the most challenging.  Having escaped Saturday -- 8-6 in the third set over Camila Giorgi -- Stephens had a surprisingly simpler time in the fourth round, easing past 25th-seed Kontaveit 6-2 6-0. Kontaveit upset Petra Kvitova on Saturday and flourished ahead of Roland Garros.  Stephens -- who plays either Wozniacki or Kasatkina on Tuesday -- snapped an 0-for-4 skid in French Open fourth rounds.  Keys said she was looking forward to Monday's blockbuster between Maria Sharapova -- they share the same agent, Max Eisenbud -- and Serena Williams.  Williams leads the series 19-2.

{"content": "Then, minutes later, he signaled that he would be leaving the team at the season's end. That the victory should come at Mugello -- in many ways MotoGP's most prestigious circuit, and the ultimate prize for a Ducati rider -- was generously laced with irony.  \"I said that winning at Mugello with Ducati was a dream for me,\" Lorenzo told reporters after the race. \"Today this dream came true. It's one of the most special wins of my entire career.\"  Moments later though, he appeared to confirm what many had suspected: that his troubled year and a half with the Italian outfit would end this season. \"It's too late\" \"I'm sad, because if the pieces that I needed (to win) had arrived much earlier, now I would say to you, 'I stay in Ducati and I have now two or three victories,'\" Lorenzo told MotoGP.com.  \"But unfortunately, they arrive too late these pieces, and now ... I win here, but it's too late, and the next two years I will be with another bike.\" Lorenzo is not the first big name to struggle at Ducati. Valentino Rossi returned to Yamaha after a miserable two years with the team, while Briton Cal Crutchlow ended his contract early to join LCR Honda.  But the Ducati package has improved enormously of late, and expectations for Lorenzo were perhaps justifiably higher. Imperious This race showed exactly why Ducati had spent a reported $14 million a year to lure Lorenzo away from Yamaha.  The five-time world champion was imperious, passing pole-sitter Rossi's Yamaha on the first corner and never looking back. The word most often used to describe Lorenzo is \"metronomic,\" and so it was here; lap after lap, this was a faultless performance that left his rivals to fight over scraps alone. Marquez's inexplicable crash If Lorenzo's race was a model of measured discipline, behind him a far more ragged affair played out. Six riders crashed out in the first three laps, and when world championship leader Marc Marquez inexplicably slid out from an ominous looking second place, Lorenzo's victory seemed all but assured. The home crowd was then treated to an enthralling battle of the Italians for the remaining podium places.  Andrea Dovizioso eventually took control of second, giving Ducati a memorable one-two, while home favorite Rossi clinched third after fighting off Suzuki's Andrea Iannone. Ducati leaves door ajar Ducati team principal, Gigi Dall'Igna, appeared to leave the door ajar for Lorenzo after the race.  \"I think it's really difficult for him to continue with us,\" he told MotoGP.com.  \"But never say no, so we will see what happens in the next weeks.\" The result sees Rossi climb into second place in the standings.  Marquez, who remounted after his crash but finished outside the points, remains on top but with his lead cut to 23 points.  Lorenzo's heroics move him up to tenth position.

It is unusual but not unique. Former FIFA President Sepp Blatter once warned of the threat of naturalized Brazilian \"invaders\" populating the teams of other countries. In recent years strikers Diego Costa and Eduardo have controversially represented Spain and Croatia after earning dual nationalities. Xherdan Shaqiri, scorer of one of the goals of Euro 2016, has previously stitched the flags of Switzerland, Albania and Kosovo onto his boots. Then there's Bundesliga star Leon Bailey, the Jamaican who isn't sure if he wants to play for Jamaica. Several sets of brothers, from the Xhakas to the Boatengs to the Berishas, are divided by duty to different nations.  \"The world is changing, immigration is changing,\" said FIFA Vice President Victor Montagliani in late 2017.  \"There are nationality issues that pop up all over the world ... so it's a good time to have a look at this and see if there are solutions, without hurting the integrity of the game.\" As countries become increasingly cosmopolitan so, in general, do their football teams.  Of the 32 sides at Russia 2018, over 9% of players were born outside of the country they represented in qualifying. When Iran face Morocco in Group B's opening fixture, the latter's starting eleven could be made up entirely of European-born players.  Two decades on from the exploits of France's \"Rainbow Team\" -- when a side comprised of players from all over the francophone world united a divided country -- the notion of nationality in modern football is as divisive and complex as ever ...  Ghoddos - 'Representing both Sweden and Iran' Ghoddos, star of \u00d6stersunds FK's fairy-tale rise from Swedish obscurity to the Europa League knockout stages, was born and raised in the Scandinavian nation. A life beside the Baltic Sea is all he has ever known.  \"I had both the Swedish flag and the Iranian flag on my bedroom wall actually when I was a child,\" Ghoddos tells CNN Sport. \"Of course, I didn't really think about what country I would play for; it was more a case of finding a club.\" It was naturally a dream come true when Sweden manager Janne Andersson came calling in early 2017, giving Ghoddos his first taste of international football in friendlies against the Ivory Coast and Slovakia.  Technically proficient with an eye for goal, Ghoddos scored with his first shot on target, maintaining that form as he directly contributed to goals against Galatasary, PAOK, Athletic Bilbao, Zorya and even Arsenal during his club's European adventure.  \"The stronger the team we were playing against, the easier it was for me to compete at their level,\" says Ghoddos, who hopes to play for \"one of the bigger teams in Germany, England, Spain or Italy\" a year from now. Suddenly he was attracting envious glances from elsewhere. Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger called him a \"marvelous player both technically and tactically,\" with a host of English Premier League sides including West Ham and Leicester reportedly sending scouts.  They weren't the only ones.  Ghoddos's parents hail from the Southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz -- a fact not lost on Iran boss Carlos Queiroz. The talented Swede, after all, hadn't yet played a competitive international. He was still eligible to switch allegiances to Iran, despite having never visited the country.  \"Queiroz said he was really interested in me and he really liked my football and how I'm playing,\" says Ghoddos, recalling their initial telephone conversation in June 2017. \"He said that I would be a good asset for the team.\"  Suddenly the player was forced to arrive at a decision he never thought he'd have to make. Did he consider himself Swedish or Iranian? \"It's a really hard question because it's deeper than that,\" says Ghoddos, who admitted at the time his loyalties were split \"50:50.\"  \"I love both countries, and believe I can represent both,\" he adds. READ: A day in the life of the 'Egyptian King' After administrative delays from FIFA -- during which Sweden made a late attempt to change his mind -- Iran, a nation with a solitary World Cup victory in its history, won the race for his permanent allegiance. \"They gave me the most interest. I don't know how to explain it, it was only Iran first,\" says Ghoddos. \"They said: 'You should come here and play in the playoffs for the World Cup,' and I didn't hear anything from Sweden. As soon as I picked Iran, it was then that Sweden came.\" It was a case of only realizing what you have when it's gone for Andersson, who admitted the Swedish football association had \"obviously hoped for a different decision.\" As for Ghoddos, the striker is now set to pull on the white jersey of Iran at the Russia 2018 World Cup after being named in Querioz's 32-man initial squad -- something he says is beyond his \"biggest dreams.\" \"Of course it's really big for me, and for my family,\" says the 24-year-old. \"I can't imagine how proud they are of me. So I will play for them and for me too.\"  Having submitted a \"written, substantiated request\" to FIFA, Ghoddos visited Iran for the first time in September 2017 to join up with the national side after receiving his new passport from the embassy. His new teammates welcomed him with open arms, assuring him he had made a \"good decision,\" and he has since played for Team Melli on seven occasions, finding the net against Panama. With World Cup group stage fixtures against Portugal, Morocco and Spain to come, it's not going to be easy but Ghoddos is confident Iran can spring a surprise.  \"Of course I think that! I have to think like that,\" he enthuses. \"It's like when \u00d6stersunds played in the Europa League: every game people expected us to lose but instead we were thinking within the team 'we can make it,' believing in ourselves.  \"It's the same thing with Iran. The World Cup, we have to just believe in ourselves. I think it's a good team with really good players, so anything can happen. We will just believe in ourselves that it's possible to win all of the games.\"  Off the pitch, the two cultures are markedly different; as it stands, Iranian women are still not allowed to enter football stadiums. But Ghoddos has no regrets. \"I love both countries so it was really special for me the first time pulling on the Sweden shirt, and it was the same thing when I put the Iran shirt on,\" he says. \"It was really an honor for me that I could represent both countries. \"It will be a good chance to show what I can do, of course, but that's not why I'm playing for Iran. I play for my heart and for the flag. That's the feeling you get when you play for a national team.\" It's not that likely to come to pass, but should Iran and Sweden face each other at the World Cup, what would be running through his mind in the tunnel?  \"Oh, my adrenaline would be so high,\" laughs Ghoddos. \"It's crazy, but I would love to play that game ...\"  Wilfried Zaha -- 'No regret at all' Another player with no regrets is Premier League star Wilfried Zaha, though the Crystal Palace forward won't be going to the World Cup.  Born in Ivorian city of Abidjan, Zaha moved to Thornton Heath in 1997 at age four with his eight siblings, honing his extravagant skills in the parks of Greater London. While still a Championship player in 2012, Zaha admitted his loyalties were equally split, saying: \"I was born in Ivory Coast but all I know is England; when the time comes, I'll make a choice.\" That choice initially appeared to be England, with Zaha representing the Under-19s, U-21s and finally England's senior side in two friendlies. But in November 2016, after four years without a cap, at the age of 24 and in the form of his career, Zaha opted for his country of birth.  He was pilloried in the English media for a lack of patience, fight and desire, with former defender Danny Mills suggesting he had taken the \"easy option\" and manager Gareth Southgate questioning the player's \"inherent desire.\" Zaha, though, just wanted to feel appreciated.  \"It was just like I was rejected from the England side,\" he tells CNN Sport, having been named in the Team of the Season at the recent Best of Africa awards. \"I didn't get picked or even get a look in for four years.  \"Four years in football is a long time so it's like there's no regret at all. No one even thought about me at all. And Ivory Coast, even though I told them no, they still had the belief in me and still wanted me because they knew what I could do for the team.\"  In the wake of Southgate's comments, Zaha's representatives issued a statement asserting it was his \"personal choice and right as a senior player to accept the opportunity to represent his nation of birth and that of his family heritage.\" It went on to add: \"His 'desire' or 'passion' should never have been publicly questioned for making that decision.\" Zaha had been personally urged to represent the Elephants by none other than Didier Drogba and openly relishes the fact that he left Ivory Coast as a \"nobody\" and returned as a \"hero.\" \"Obviously we may not be in the World Cup but it's just a learning curve,\" says the winger. \"From there, what we need to do is just get better and hopefully try and get into the next one. \"As for me not playing for England, I've got no regret at all. I'm happy with the decision I made.\"  Don't think he won't still be supporting Southgate's men at Russia 2018, though.  \"Yeah, why not?!\" exclaims Zaha. \"I live here, I've lived here since I was four, so why not support them. I've got a lot of friends in the team so yeah I wish them the best.\"  Vincent Kompany - '100% Belgian, 100% Congolese' While the depth of talent in Belgium's national team is currently the envy of Europe, not everyone is aware of the cultural and linguistic divides in both the country and the team -- where some speak French, others converse in Flemish, and not all players are capable of understanding both.   Able to speak fluently in five languages, Vincent Kompany \u2014 a second-generation immigrant \u2014 has emerged as a leader and unifying force for both club and country. On Monday he was named in Belgium's 23-man World Cup squad despite picking up an injury in a friendly against Portugal on June 2. The Manchester City defender, born to a Congolese father and Belgian mother in Brussels, believes it's a privilege to be able represent more than one nation at a time.  \"I represent my heritage. I feel 100% Belgian and 100% Congolese,\" Kompany tells CNN, having previously helped build a village in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa.  \"I'm proud of that. It's a wealth on my side to be able to do that.\"  \"I'll try to do well with Belgium and if I do, I hope that a lot of people in Congo as well will feel proud of my achievements.\"  A decade has passed since Kompany joined City from Hamburg for an undisclosed fee believed to be around \u00a37.5 million ($10 million). Big-money stars have been and gone, five managers have walked the touchline, but Kompany has been a constant rock.   \"There's a lot of people in Manchester that feel associated with Belgium when me and Kevin [de Brunye] walk out, you know?\" he says, illustrating the potential fluidity of national sentiment. \"There's nothing wrong with that.\"  The club captain's wife is a Mancunian, he celebrated the recent title win in a local pub and perhaps there's even a hint of a Manchester accent creeping in.  Is there a part of him, however small, that's starting to feel English?  \"I start sounding more and more like an English guy!\" he laughs. \"Look, my kids are English so I have no problem. I like the country, I like the culture, I like how I've been received here.  \"But to say I'm English, I can't quite get the words out yet. But I feel Manc, yeah!\" ", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/04/sport/nationality-football-kompany-zaha-ghoddos-world-cup/index.html", "description": "Growing up in Malm\u00f6, Saman Ghoddos had the flags of both Sweden and Iran on his bedroom wall.

{"content": "The draft, put forward by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling right-wing Fidesz party, is known locally as the \"Stop Soros\" law.    The proposed new legislation would make several basic human rights activities illegal. Helping refugees fill in forms, distributing information to asylum seekers about how to claim refuge, or organizing professional networks to help migrants could result in a possible jail sentence as punishment, according to the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group. The bill will be voted on in a week and could be law within a month, according to the Hungarian Parliament's website.  The government has been waging a campaign to vilify Hungarian-born billionaire investor George Soros as a threat to national security, in a drive which many believe has anti-Semitic undertones.   \"EU law clearly sets out that while the asylum procedure is going on, asylum-seekers have the right to stay in the country,\" the Hungarian Helsinki Committee said in a statement. \"The Hungarian government, instead of heeding widespread international outcries, raises the stakes.\" Immigration featured prominently in April's election that saw Orban returned to power with a crushing landslide.  Hungary's EU partners are trying to persuade Budapest to drastically modify the new law, and the issue is likely to feature prominently on the agenda of the German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas when he meets Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto in Berlin on Monday afternoon. \"The people of Hungary have made it clear that they do not want Hungary to become an immigrant country,\" a spokesperson for Hungary's interior ministry told CNN. \"They have made it clear that they want to live in security, and that they expect and support the government's introduction of further measures in the interest of Hungary's security, and prevention of the organization of illegal migration.\" Barrier of barbed wire Hungary came under major international fire in 2015 when it erected a fence topped with barbed wire to keep out refugees fleeing war in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.  More than 391,000 refugees crossed into the country in 2015. That number dropped to just 203 in 2018, according to the interior ministry.   \"The EU must take action to make Hungary stop threatening human rights and civil society,\" Fotis Filippou, the campaigns director for Europe for Amnesty International, told CNN. \"These proposed laws fly in the face of EU law and international law.\"  A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU executive, said Brussels was waiting to see the final draft before deciding on what action it will take.  In May the Budapest branch of Open Society Foundations, which was founded by Soros, announced it was leaving Hungary for Germany because of the difficulty working in the former Communist country.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/04/europe/hungary-immigrants-crackdown-intl/index.html", "description": "Hungary's parliament is set to debate draft legislation Tuesday that would shut down organizations and even imprison people who help illegal immigrants, in a move that has alarmed human rights groups as well as the European Union, of which Hungary is a member.

Her sister, mother and a friend all pleaded guilty to terrorism offenses at an earlier hearing. \"Safaa Boular's intention was to cause serious injury and death. She planned to do this in Syria by detonating a suicide belt with her fianc\u00e9 by her side,\" said the head of the Crown Prosecution Service's counterterrorism division, Sue Hemming.  \"When she was prevented from travelling, her focus switched to an attack on the British Museum where there would be a large crowd,\" said Hemming.

She was stopped by police at Stansted airport, north of London, and admitted to plans to travel to Syria to join ISIS fighter Naweed Hussain. She said she wanted to support a suicide attack he was plotting while the pair held hands.  After her travel plans were thwarted, she continued to chat with Hussain online and set plans in motion to carry out an attack on the British Museum using grenades and firearms. Hussain was killed on April 4, 2017. After his death, Boular sent a message to someone she considered an ISIS supporter asking for \"martyrdom for his sake.\" She and her sister, Rizlaine Boular, 22, talked about planning a \"party\" on April 27, 2017, which the prosecution argued was code for terror attack. The plan was supported by her mother and friend, according to the CPS. \"They all present a danger to the public and will be sentenced for their actions,\" said Hemming. She is the youngest female charged with planning an ISIS attack in the country, according to the Press Association. Last week, a British ISIS supporter admitted to calling on jihadis to attack 4-year-old Prince George.

{"content": "A report by fire safety engineer Barbara Lane found that a little over 30 minutes after the first emergency calls were made early on June 14, the fire service's \"stay put\" strategy had \"effectively failed.\"  Britain uses a passive strategy during fires, which means people are typically advised to stay in their apartments when there is a blaze elsewhere in the building, as firefighters try to contain the flames. Seventy-two people died after fire broke out in the West London tower block in what became the deadliest fire in the United Kingdom since 1988. Residents initially were told by emergency services to stay put inside their flats, only to be told to evacuate almost two hours after the first emergency call, as firefighters struggled to stop the blaze racing up the facade of the building.  However, Lane said, there was \"an early need for a total evacuation of Grenfell Tower.\" But she also conceded: \"I do not wish to imply this was an easy decision to make during the unfolding and complex events that occurred.\" In her report, Lane highlighted a \"culture of non-compliance at Grenfell Tower.\" Among her findings were: -- Cladding was \"non-compliant\" with building regulations and produced toxic smoke that impeded firefighters.-- Firefighters \"were unable to control the fireman's lift,\" which caused a short delay to arriving at the initial site of the blaze. -- Stairway fire doors had not been replaced since 1972 and did not meet current benchmarks.  -- All flat entrance doors were noncompliant with fire-safety regulations, including more than 100 that had been replaced in 2011. -- Firefighters were unable to get enough water up to the higher levels of the 24-story building, partly because the building was fitted with a noncompliant dry main, rather than a regulation-required wet main that could have provided more water. -- The ventilation system \"did not operate as intended.\"  The inquiry was shown a video taken by members of the public showing how quickly the fire spread throughout the building.  \"The type of materials and how they were arranged around windows in the kitchen, contributed to the speed at which the fire spread from the flat of fire origin to a multistory external fire,\" said Lane. Lane added that she had \"found no evidence\" that design or construction teams had investigated the fire performance of the cladding before it was installed during a refurbishment between 2012 and 2016. Heartbreaking tales from families The inquiry, chaired by retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, is tasked with establishing what happened at Grenfell and making recommendations to prevent a similar fire from causing such devastation again.  It opened late last month with heart-rending tributes from bereaved families who lost loved ones. They included Marcio Gomes, who told of the devastation of losing his unborn son hours after he and his family escaped the inferno. His pregnant wife, Andreia Gomes, was put in an induced coma after the couple and their two young daughters ran from the 21st floor of the building at four in the morning. She gave birth hours later to a stillborn baby, whom they named Logan.

Meanwhile Kim was closing the gap. Fast.  The South Korean, who shot a major record 61 at the 2014 Evian Championship, steadily chipped away at Jutanugarn's lead, ending the round as the only player with a blemish-free scorecard.  The Thai, by contrast, made further bogeys on the 12th, 17th and 18th. A playoff awaited.  READ: Jordan Spieth still \"haunted\" by infamous Masters collapse The key to success?

I tried hard to do that.  \"After you have a seven-shot lead and have to go to a playoff, you kind of have no expectation. I got mad a little bit about what happened in my back nine, but I decided I'd just make sure I'd do my best to every shot.  \"Because I felt disappointed already, I didn't think about the outcome.

His straight sets victory against Wilander -- the defending champion who was just 18 years old -- in 1983 certainly didn't go down as one of the all-time great finals, but none in Roland Garros history arguably have been more emotional. The embrace with his father, Zacharie, who had watched his son leave his native Cameroon to train in France 10 years earlier as a 13-year-old, became one of the French Open's defining images. READ: Rafael Nadal -- Why the 'King of Clay' reigns in Paris READ: Serena Williams pulls out of French Open \"I'm really thankful that I've won my grand slam at home,\" Noah told CNN's Pat Cash. \"I won, I practiced here, pretty much on this court, before the final.  \"Then I go out and play and all my friends (were there), everywhere I look there are my friends and I could share this moment. It was complete and I think I got the energy from them.\" Noah was the first Frenchman to win at Roland Garros for 37 years, and no Frenchman has lifted the trophy in the 35 years since.  It appears as though the drought won't end anytime soon, since the once golden generation of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Richard Gasquet, Gael Monfils and Gilles Simon are nearing the end of their careers.  The French fans are notoriously passionate when it comes to supporting their compatriots on the red clay, with many suggesting it brings pressure the current players can't handle. Noah, however, feels decidedly differently. \"I don't feel it,\" he says, shaking his head. \"I feel it's love, man. And I mean, Jesus, people come and say they love you.  \"Some people feel this way (pressure) but you are lucky enough to have a grand slam at home, you know? God, there are four.  \"You have French, you have Australians, Americans and English but it's such a privilege. We practice in Roland Garros so you have all the dreams right here.\" 'King of Clay' The man to beat this year, once again, is Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard is going for a record-extending 11th title at Roland Garros having lost just two matches at the tournament throughout his career. Noah had the privilege of watching the \"King of Clay\" up close during a training session and was left in awe of his prowess. \"I saw him practice ... it's fantastic. You wanna show all the kids ... this is the No. 1 in the world,\" said Noah.   \"And because of that I think it's really good. I'm happy when he wins these days. It was not always the way, to tell you the truth. But now it's something different, man, you gotta give him respect, man. Crazy.\" So how would Noah try to beat the seemingly unbeatable Nadal? \"I only play drop shots, only drop shots,\" he laughs. \"You're going to miss points but I would serve underarm and every time I play drop shots.  \"If he is at the net, I hit it straight at him,\" he quips. \"You have to try something!\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/05/tennis/yannick-noah-french-open-roland-garros-rafael-nadal/index.html", "description": "Yannick Noah turned as the ball sailed over his head and watched it land outside the baseline.", "title": "French Open: Yannick Noah -- The last Frenchman to win Roland Garros", "author": "Matias Grez, CNN", "date": "2018-06-05 09:10:53"},
{"content": "No, the Russian didn't end a demoralizing 14-year losing streak against the American. Rather, Sharapova didn't have to face Williams after the new mom pulled out with a pectoral injury at the last minute.   The 23-time grand slam winner played herself into form through three rounds in her grand slam comeback but she took to the main interview room Monday to announce her withdrawal just minutes before the clash between two of the highest profile athletes in the world was about to start on Philippe-Chatrier court in Paris. It was her first grand slam withdrawal mid tournament.   The 36-year-old said she couldn't \"physically serve\" due to the pectoral problem, adding she first felt the injury in the third round against Julia Goerges on Saturday and then again in Sunday's doubles tussle with older sister Venus. She has never had that type of injury, Serena said.  The siblings -- one of the finest doubles teams ever -- lost 6-0 in the third set to third seeds Andreja Klepac and Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez, with Serena's serve speed visibly declining.    She'll have an MRI scan Tuesday to discover the extent of the injury and the results will no doubt determine her availability for Wimbledon, which begins in exactly four weeks.  \"I unfortunately been having some issues with my pec muscle ... right now I can't actually serve so it's actually hard to play when I can't physically serve,\" said Williams. \"This is so painful.\"  The French Open marked only her third tournament of 2018 -- and first since March -- after Williams gave birth to daughter Olympia in September.  Williams told CNN she almost died in the aftermath due to complications stemming from a pulmonary embolism, a condition that left her on her \"death bed\" in 2011.    Her departure means Sharapova, who held a 2-19 record against Williams, moved into the last eight against 2016 winner Garbine Muguruza. Muguruza didn't get a walkover but almost: The Spaniard progressed when Lesia Tsurenko retired with a leg injury losing 2-0 in the first set.   \"I was looking forward to my match against Serena today and am disappointed that she had to withdraw,\" Sharapova told the WTA. \"I wish her a speedy recovery and hope she returns to the tour soon.\" Williams had added extra spice to the contest beforehand, slamming Sharapova's \"hearsay\" autobiography. In it, Sharapova described hearing \"guttural sobs\" from Williams after defeating her in the 2004 Wimbledon final.  Williams appeared to dispute Sharapova's account and said anything that happens in the locker room should stay there.  'Back to the drawing board' \"It's very difficult, because I love playing Maria,\" said Williams. \"It's just a match I always get up for. Just her game matches so well against mine. It is difficult, because ... I have given up so much to be here.  \"There are times where I'm on the court and I'm practicing, and I look on the monitor and I see my daughter and she's playing and I want to be there, but I know that these are the sacrifices you have to make to live out your dream. \"And I have made every sacrifice that I could. So it's extremely disappointing. But also I made a promise to myself and to my coach and to my team that if I'm not at least 60% or 50%, then I probably shouldn't play.  \"The fact that I physically can't serve at all is a good indication that maybe I should just go back to the drawing board and stay positive and try to get better and not get it to a point where it could be a lot worse.\" So why did Williams play in the doubles Sunday in the first place?  \"I really felt like I needed to because I'm never going to know how I feel under match play if I didn't have that match,\" said Williams.  \"Plus I wanted to try different tapings and different strappings and lots of different stuff to see what's helping and what can help and what I could try in my singles match.\"  Wozniacki out, Nadal still in Williams' good friend, second-seed Caroline Wozniacki, also exited the French Open. Resuming her encounter against Daria Kasatkina after darkness halted play Sunday, the Russian won all three games for a 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 victory and a spot in a maiden grand slam quarterfinal.   Since losing her first set of the tournament, world No. 1 Simona Halep has cruised. Last year's finalist thumped Australian Open semifinalist Elise Mertens -- who had been 16-1 on clay this season -- 6-2 6-1 to set up a clash with Angelique Kerber. The twice grand slam winner knocked out the last remaining French player in singles, Caroline Garcia, 6-2 6-3.  When Kerber and Halep met in the Australian Open semifinals, Halep saved two match points and prevailed 9-7 in the third set. No wonder Kerber, looking ahead to the quarterfinal, said: \"I think it will be a long match.\"  Rafael Nadal, meanwhile, advanced to a 12th quarterfinal and has now won 37 straight sets at Roland Garros after defeating the spirited Maximilian Marterer of Germany 6-3 6-2 7-6 (7-4). In his first grand slam fourth round, the free-swinging 22-year-old led Nadal by a break in the first and third sets.   Nadal turned 32 Sunday but said he didn't feel old.  \"I am here around since 2003, so it's a long way, a lot of years,\" he said. \"I started very young. That's a real thing. But, no, I feel happy to be here. Being honest, I am enjoying the day by day on the tour and I hope to keep doing this for a while.\" The 10-time winner will next face a familiar foe, 11th-seed Diego Schwartzman, who rallied from two sets down to beat Kevin Anderson 1-6 2-6 7-5 7-6 (7-0) 6-2. Anderson -- defeated by Nadal in the US Open final -- twice couldn't serve the match out, ending his bid to become the first South African man to make the French Open quarterfinals since Cliff Drysdale in 1967. Asked how he maintained belief when trailing the 6-foot-8 Anderson, the 5-foot-7 Schwartzman replied: \"Did you read David and Goliath?\"  Visit CNN.com/tennis for more news, features and videos Nadal leads Schwartzman 5-0 in their series but the ever improving Argentine took a set off the Mallorcan at the Australian Open in January.

{"content": "Some fear he seeks to drive a wedge in it.  The official reason for the trip, Putin's first foreign visit since he won a landslide re-election in March, is for talks with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and President Alexander Van der Bellen. Trade and economic cooperation are at the top of the agenda: Putin is slated to attend a meeting with Russian and Austrian business representatives to discuss investment opportunities and economic cooperation.  But the Kremlin leader is looking for an opening to a Europe that is witnessing a rise of right-wing, populist governments, with a clear aim of easing sanctions and ending Russia's political isolation.   Austrian vice chancellor opposes sanctions Austria is an interesting case in point. Late last year, a new coalition government took power in Vienna that includes the far-right Freedom Party as a junior partner. Heinz-Christian Strache, Austria's vice chancellor and leader of the Freedom Party, is an opponent of sanctions, which were imposed by the European Union and the US over Russia's annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014.   In a recent interview with the newspaper Oesterreich, Strache made his position clear. \"It is high time to put an end to these exasperating sanctions and normalize political and economic relations with Russia,\" he said.  The Austrian government has also done another major favor for Putin. It opted not to join over 20 other countries in expelling Russian diplomats over the March 4 nerve agent attack against Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, in Salisbury, England.   That's raised questions in Austria about the real agenda for Putin's visit.  'We want a united European Union' In an interview with Austria's ORF television channel on the eve of his trip, Putin was asked if his trip was \"a kind of incentive for a benevolent policy toward Russia\" by the Austrian government.   \"It is not our aim to divide anything or anybody in Europe,\" Putin said. \"On the contrary, we want to see a united and prosperous European Union, because the European Union is our biggest trade and economic partner. The more problems there are within the European Union, the greater the risks and uncertainties for us.\" Still, it's an interesting move by Putin, who has looked for new partners amid frosty relations with Washington and Brussels.  Later this week, Putin will pay an official visit to China for a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in the eastern city Qingdao. Putin has nurtured close ties to Chinese President Xi Jinping, and he has looked for greater economic support from Beijing in the face of sanctions. The shifting political winds in Europe may also give him a new opening. Italy, which has wavered in the past about sanctioning Russia, has a new coalition government led by populist, euroskeptic parties, League and the Five Star Movement. Both are broadly pro-Russian.  Following Hungary's lead? But it's still too early to say whether goodwill in Austria or other European countries can translate into a real easing of sanctions for Putin.  Writing after the election of the new Austrian government for the Carnegie Moscow Center, political scientist Stanislav Klimovich said, \"Observers fear that the Freedom Party will radicalize its new coalition with the center-right Austrian People's Party. They worry that the Austrian government will close the country's borders, fraternize with Russia, and drag the political system in the illiberal direction taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\" Such moves, Klimovich added, would be tempered.  \"Both the People's Party and the Freedom Party have since distanced themselves from these politicians,\" he said. \"And after the election, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz unequivocally stated that his government 'will be pro-European or it will not exist.'\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/05/europe/putin-austria-visit-analysis-intl/index.html", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin visits Austria on Tuesday, and he says he wants to build bridges to Europe.

{"content": "The term \"spouse\" is gender-neutral and includes same-sex partners, the Court of Justice of the European Union concluded in its judgment. Member states should grant all married couples the right to move and reside freely within the EU, regardless of their sexual orientation, the court said. With its judgment, the court sided with a gay couple who was denied the right to reside together in Romania, which does not recognize same-sex marriage.  Advocacy groups hailed the court's judgment as the first of its kind to include same-sex couples in the definition of spouse for the purpose of free movement, which allows EU citizens to move and reside freely among member states. But it stopped short of obligating Romania or other member states to allow same-sex marriage. While member states are free to decide whether to allow same-sex marriage within their borders, the court said that they should recognize same-sex marriages performed in other EU states for the purposes of residency and free movement. \"Equality, fairness and pragmatism were at the core of today's verdict from Luxembourg. The CJEU has acknowledged that rainbow families should be recognized equally in the eyes of the law on freedom of movement,\" Evelyne Paradis, executive director of advocacy group ILGA-Europe, said in a statement. \"Now we want to see the Romanian authorities ... move swiftly to make this judgment a reality.\" The couple behind the ruling Adrian Coman, a dual US-Romanian citizen, met Claibourn Hamilton, a US citizen, in New York in June 2002. The two lived there together from 2005 to 2009.  Coman moved to Brussels in 2009 to work at the European Parliament as a parliamentary assistant while Hamilton stayed in New York. They were married in Brussels in 2010. In December 2012, when Coman's employment ended, the couple considered moving to Romania to be closer to Coman's family. They contacted Romanian authorities to find out how Hamilton could obtain the right to work and reside lawfully there for more than three months as a member of Coman's family.  Under the EU's right to free movement, non-EU spouses married to EU citizens may join their partner in a member state where the European national resides. The couple sought a residency permit for Hamilton based on the right to free movement, assuming it would apply to Hamilton. Romanian authorities said that Hamilton could not be classified as a spouse of an EU citizen in Romania because it does not recognize marriage between persons of the same sex.  The couple brought an action before the Romanian courts seeking a declaration of discrimination based on sexual orientation. Romania's Constitutional Court asked the Court of Justice to determine if Hamilton should be considered a spouse of an EU citizen with the same right to permanent residency.  Because the term \"spouse\" includes same-sex partners, member states must treat them the same as any other spouse, the court ruled. To refuse residency to an EU citizen's spouse may interfere with that citizen's right to move freely. The court emphasized that recognizing same-sex marriages performed in another member state \"does not require that Member State to provide, in its national law, for the institution of homosexual marriage.\" Nor does it \"undermine the national identity or pose a threat to the public policy of the Member State concerned.\" While the ruling leaves the state of same-sex marriage in Romania in limbo, Coman and others are calling it a win. \"We can now look in the eyes of any public official in Romania and across the EU with certainty that our relationship is equally valuable and equally relevant, for the purpose of free movement within the EU,\" Coman said in a statement through ILGA-Europe.  \"We are grateful to the EU Court and to the many people and institutions who have supported us, and through us, other same-sex couples in a similar situation,\" he said. \"It is human dignity that wins today.\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/05/europe/ecj-ruling-same-sex-couples-free-movement/index.html", "description": "Same-sex couples are entitled to the same residency rights as other married couples, even in member states that don't recognize gay marriage, the European Union Court of Justice concluded.", "title": "EU's top court backs residency rights for same-sex couples", "author": "Emanuella Grinberg, CNN", "date": "2018-06-06 02:44:59"},

{"content": "The latest player to be hindered by injury in Paris, Djokovic received a medical timeout for what appeared to be a neck or shoulder problem at the end of the first set and fell 6-3 7-6 (7-3) 1-6 7-6 (13-11) to the 72nd-ranked Italian in nearly three and a half hours.  Cecchinato converted on his fourth match point in the gripping deciding tiebreak, his backhand return looping in down the line as the Serb served and volleyed. Djokovic couldn't convert three set points in the tiebreak -- on the last one at 9-8 he erred on a short forehand with his opponent stranded -- and also failed to serve out the set at 5-3.  Still, he graciously crossed the net to exchange a hug with Cecchinato -- they have practiced together in Monte Carlo -- when the quarterfinal concluded on court Suzanne-Lenglen.    The 12-time grand slam winner entered the French Open with momentum after an elbow injury and loss of motivation led to a downturn: He stretched the \"King of Clay\" Rafael Nadal in their semifinal at the Italian Open last month.  So losing to Cecchinato was a blow.    \"Any defeat is difficult in the grand slams, especially the one that came from months of buildup,\" Djokovic said. \"And I thought I had a great chance to get at least a step further, but it wasn't to be. That's the way it is.\" One to usually elaborate in his news conferences, Djokovic was in little mood to chat with reporters.  No details of injury He acknowledged there was an injury but didn't go into too much detail. \"A couple of things, but nothing major really,\" he said.  But then Djokovic offered no guarantees of playing the grass-court swing.  \"I don't know if I'm going to play on grass,\" he added.  Combining power, finesse and stellar movement, Cecchinato and his glorious one-handed backhand became the lowest-ranked men's semifinalist at the French Open since Andrei Medvedev in 1999.  His \"dream\" continues, two years after being handed an 18-month ban for match fixing by Italy's tennis federation. The ban was later overturned.    \"Am I dreaming? Maybe I'm sleeping,\" Cecchinato told the crowd. \"I don't understand (anything).\" Cecchinato is undeniably playing the finest tennis of career, a stretch that started when the 25-year-old won the Budapest title in April as a lucky loser.  And even before ousting one of tennis' all-time greats Tuesday, he had an eventful tournament, rallying from two sets down in his opener against Marius Copil for a first grand slam win and then overcoming the lucky loser that captivated fans worldwide, Marco Trungelliti.  If that wasn't enough, Cecchinato got the better of two of the top clay-court players on the tour, Pablo Carreno Busta and David Goffin.  Cecchinato next meets Dominic Thiem, who defeated second-seed Alexander Zverev 6-4 6-2 6-1. Zverev, 21, also received a medical timeout for a leg injury and was visibly hampered against the Austrian in his first grand slam quarterfinal. His upper left leg was heavily strapped.  Thiem, meanwhile, advanced to a third consecutive semifinal at the French Open and will be the heavy favorite against Cecchinato on Friday. You can bet he won't be taking him lightly, though.   As for Cecchinato, he recalled beating Thiem in a Futures event in Italy on clay in 2013. \"I remember this match,\" he said.  The stakes are higher Friday.  On Monday, Serena Williams withdrew from her high-profile clash with Maria Sharapova due to a pectoral injury and Lesia Tsurenko quit after two games of her encounter with Garbine Muguruza because of a leg injury. All American semifinal  Madison Keys will face pal and fellow American Sloane Stephens in the women's semifinals in a rematch of the US Open final won by Stephens in September.  Keys edged the diminutive, fiery Yulia Putintseva 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 while Stephens breezed past Caroline Wozniacki's conqueror, Daria Kasatkina, 6-3 6-1 in the Russian's first grand slam quarterfinal.  Hard courts have been kind to American players, with clay often a struggle. When Keys and Stephens duel Thursday, it will mark the first all-American semifinal at the year's second major since Williams beat Jennifer Capriati in 2002.  Yes, new mum Williams has stood the test of time.  Only Djokovic will know whether his lack of matches -- and not being in peak shape -- in the last 12 months were contributing factors to his injury, which surfaced very early.   He shook his left arm and stretched his neck prior to calling for the trainer at 2-5. When the first set ended, the trainer returned for a full medical timeout.  Djokovic looked better but Cecchinato didn't back down. After Djokovic reversed a break deficit and saved two break points at 3-3, Cecchinato saved three set points serving at 5-6. He bossed the rally on all three but his pick-up at 0-30 from a rocketed Djokovic forehand could have been the key point in the game.   He claimed the final four points of the second-set tiebreak, a spell that began when Djokovic sent a backhand drop shot into the net.  Winning two sets against one of the \"Big Four\" is one thing but winning three is a different proposition entirely.  Cecchinato temporarily blinked and a more aggressive Djokovic grabbed the third in 30 minutes. The fourth set began in similar fashion. Djokovic led 4-1 and held three break points for 5-1.  Couldn't serve it out  Cecchinato hung on to start the turnaround, although Djokovic will be miffed for not serving the set out at 5-3, 30-0.  Into the tiebreak it went and Djokovic saved the first match point with a stunning, angled backhand volley that caught the line. The pro-Djokovic crowd was off its feet and even more so when he struck a reflex backhand volley on the next point when Cecchinato had ample time on his backhand.  They continued to go back and forth until Cecchinato's sublime return.  \"It's tough to say the emotion in the tiebreak,\" said Cecchinato. \"I was very nervous because so many chances, so many match points.\" Cecchinato once again didn't want to discuss his 2016 saga when it was brought up.   On Wednesday, the four remaining semifinalists in both draws will be determined. Nadal carries a 37-set winning streak at Roland Garros into his match against friend and 11th-seed Diego Schwartzman, while 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro plays the 2014 winner in New York, Marin Cilic.

Tennis player Serena Williams was the sole female representative last year, coming in at 51st.  Though a number of sports tournaments now pay men and women equal prize money -- in 1973 not one sport rewarded both genders equally -- this year's list starkly highlights that the pace of change is slow and a huge disparity remains.  Having not played much in the last 12 months owing to pregnancy and maternity leave, Williams' off-court earnings of $18 million (\u00a313.4m) was not enough to make 2018's top 100. Charlotte Hornets' Nicholas Batum was ranked No. 100 with $22.9 million (\u00a317.06m).  Tennis players Maria Sharapova and Li Na have been named on the list in recent years, but Sharapova's absence from the sport because of a drugs ban and Li's retirement in 2014 means they no longer feature.  READ: Williams pulls out of French Open READ: Williams reveals 'whole new kind of fear' Kurt Badenhausen, Forbes' senior editor, told CNN Sport that on endorsements alone Williams would be ranked in the top 10. He told CNN Sport: \"Serena is still killing it off the court.  \"She's more popular than ever with corporate sponsors. By our count she banked $18 million with those partners who she still continues to be engaged with, whether it's IBM, Nike, Wilson, so she does a lot off the court. \"Her endorsement earnings would put her up in the top 10 in the world. She just hasn't any prize money to go with that. I expect once Serena is back on the court and raking up those millions in prize money we'll see her back on the list next year.\" READ: What single thing would you change to achieve gender equality? Mayweather the businessman Mayweather's fight with UFC star Conor McGregor last August ensured he reclaimed top spot from Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo with earnings of $285 (\u00a3212.8m).  The 41-year-old took home $275m from that sole bout and a further $10m in endorsements to top the list for the fourth time in seven years.  Second was Barcelona's Lionel Messi ($111m/ \u00a382.9m), who recently signed a new contract with the La Liga club, while Ronaldo ($108m/\u00a380.6m ) dropped to third having topped the list the two previous years.  \"He's a pretty good businessman despite the problems people might have with him,\" added Badenhausen of Mayweather, a man who was sentenced to 90 days in jail, serving 60 days, for domestic violence in 2012.  \"Because Floyd Mayweather was the promoter of the fight, he doesn't just get his cut as a fighter.

{"content": "Argentina's players decided to pull out of the game, which was scheduled to take place in Jerusalem on Saturday, \"in solidarity\" with superstar teammate Lionel Messi, Argentinian President Mauricio Macri told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol on Wednesday. Palestinian officials were outraged by the decision to hold the match in the contested city. On Sunday, Palestinian Football Association chief Jibril Rajoub launched a campaign against the Argentine Football Association (AFA) -- and specifically Messi -- and called on people to burn T-shirts of the soccer player. \"The AFA's acceptance to play with Israel in Jerusalem have reminded us all of how Israel uses sports as a tool to whitewash its actions,\" Rajoub said in a statement Sunday. It was unclear if the Palestinian campaign prompted Messi to quit the fixture, and the star has not publicly commented on the matter. CNN has contacted Messi for comment.  Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain called the decision \"the right thing\" in an interview on ESPN. \"We left it behind us. Good health and common sense come first and we think the right thing was not to go,\" Higuain said. An AFA official defended Argentina's decision to suspend the match as a \"positive\" development Wednesday.  \"I find it positive that the match between Argentina and Israel was suspended -- it was the right thing to do, it was not worth it,\" Hugo Moyano, Second Vice President of Argentina's Football Association (AFA) said in an interview with Argentina's Radio 10. \"What happens in these places where so many people are killed cannot be accepted by any human being. The families of the players were suffering,\" Moyano added. On Wednesday, the Israeli Football Association (IFA) laid the blame for the cancellation squarely on the shoulders of Rajoub. \"The Israel Football Association views with severity the physical and brutal threats that crossed every red line made by the head of the Palestinian Association, Jibril Rajoub, and will do everything in its power in the world of football institutions to Make Rajoub and the Palestinian FA accountable,\" the IFA said in a statement. During a news conference in Ramallah on Wednesday, Rajoub said, \"I don't think it's a political victory -- it's a sports achievement.\" He was standing next to a banner that read: \"From Palestine, Thank you Messi.\" Later, Rajoub told CNN the fault lay with Israel. \"The Israelis mixed politics with sport and this is why Argentina canceled the match,\" Rajoub said. When the fixture was first announced, a possible venue was the Israeli city of Haifa, but an official involved in promoting the match told CNN the Israeli government made clear it wanted the game to take place in Jerusalem. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin expressed concern over the \"politicization\" of the issue on Wednesday. \"This is indeed a sad morning for the supporters, amongst them some of my grandchildren, but there are values that are bigger even than Messi. The politicization that is apparent on the Argentinian side worries me a lot,\" Rivlin said. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman described it as \"a pity\" that Argentina's players \"could not stand up to the pressure that Israel-haters are inciting.\" \"We will not give into these anti-Semitic supporters of terror,\" he added.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/06/football/israel-argentina-soccer-match-intl/index.html", "description": "Argentina has called off a pre-World Cup exhibition match with Israel following political pressure and reported threats towards players, sparking outrage from Israeli officials.

It's a lot of different exercises with weights and ropes and lunges and ball tossing, he's got it all. Just that mixed with cardio, I prefer to run.\" For Guerdat, the winner of individual showjumping gold at the London Olympics, working out has always been a part of his life.  The son of a former show jumper and coach who learned to ride when he was just three years old, Guerdat played soccer in an Under-16 team in the French-speaking part of Switzerland in his early teens.  Although he eventually picked show jumping over scoring goals, he has maintained a strict fitness regime.  \"I work out a lot, because I like it,\" Guerdat, 35, told CNN. \"For a few years, I've had some back issues, I've had a back operation nine years ago and from that, I started to take it very seriously.  \"I'm working out five to six times a week, an hour or an hour-and-a-half every day. That's because it makes me feel good and I think it makes me ride better.\" READ: Tops-Alexander returns from maternity leave with win Harrie Smolders Not all riders dedicate as much time and energy as Kraut and Guerdat to their own fitness.

But now, with a stable of horses to train, coaching and a young family, there isn't much time left to go to the gym. \"I don't have as much time for that [as Guerdat],\" Smolders told CNN. \"But of course, your core stability and a certain amount of endurance are important,\" he added.  \"For sure, some people don't need it and are absolutely fine without,\" said Guerdat. \"I think it's good for me and my riding.\" READ: Smolders crowned Longines Global Champions Tour winner Rider safety For Kraut, working out is also key when it comes to rider safety.

Sharapova was back at Roland Garros for the first time since a 15-month suspension for testing positive for the banned heart drug meldonium ended last April, but her comeback has been beset by injury and she has been well short of the form that delivered five grand slam singles titles.

The fire is believed to have started in Kebede's Hotpoint fridge freezer, located in his kitchen. After hearing the smoke alarm, Kebede called emergency services and banged on each of his fourth-floor neighbors' doors shouting \"fire!\" said Menon. Kebede then returned to Flat 16, turned off the main electricity switch in the hallway, put on some trousers and left the building barefoot, carrying only the mobile phone on which he was calling emergency services, Menon told the hearing. He left without his wallet or the keys to his apartment and car, added Menon, contrary to media reports at the time that claimed Kebede packed a suitcase and escaped without raising the alarm. \"A nasty lie that was first reported in the days after the fire and sadly continues to be pedaled nearly a year later,\" said Menon. Resident hounded by 'nasty lies' Kebede, who had lived in the West London tower for 25 years after moving from his native Ethiopia, was subsequently hounded by journalists and offered witness protection by police concerned for his safety. He has since suffered health problems, which Menon did not elaborate on, and was said to be \"terrified\" of appearing at the hearing. \"It is important to stand against all the garbage that has been written,\" said Menon, adding that \"Kebede is a significant witness in the police investigation, not a criminal suspect.\" The lawyer said Kebede \"did exactly what any Grenfell fire resident who discovered a fire in their flat were told to, by the fire action notice posted outside the lift.\" \"To his enormous credit he also made sure that everybody else on the fourth floor had been warned about the fire, and only when he believed that nobody else was left on the floor did he himself leave and make his way downstairs,\" Menon added.

On Monday the inquiry heard that a litany of failings, including a controversial \"stay put\" policy and combustible cladding, contributed to a catastrophic loss of life at Grenfell. The fire was the deadliest in the United Kingdom since 1988. A report by fire-safety engineer Barbara Lane highlighted a \"culture of non-compliance at Grenfell Tower.\" Among her findings were that firefighters were unable to get enough water up to the higher levels of the 24-story building, partly because the building was fitted with a noncompliant dry main, rather than a regulation-required wet main that could have provided more water.  Last month the inquiry also heard heart-rending tributes from bereaved families who lost loved ones, including Marcio Gomes, who told of the devastation of losing his unborn son hours after he and his family escaped the inferno. His pregnant wife, Andreia Gomes, was put in an induced coma after the couple and their two young daughters ran from the 21st floor of the building at four in the morning. She gave birth hours later to a stillborn baby, whom they named Logan.

Not that Silva is deterred.

{"content": "1966: Geoff Hurst's controversial goal -- did it cross the line?  The 1966 edition of the World Cup offered a helter-skelter final at Wembley, the spiritual home of football. West Germany opened the scoring before being pinned back by England, who then went on to take the advantage. Germany came back bravely to equalize late, making the score 2-2 and sending the game into extra time. And then came the controversy.  Running onto a cross from Alan Ball, England's Geoff Hurst controlled the ball and shot high, beating the keeper but hitting the crossbar. The ball bounced straight down, making it virtually impossible to tell if it had crossed the line. Hands from both sides shot up and a tense few minutes ensued, with the Soviet linesman, Tofik Bakhramov of Azerbaijan, first denying the goal and then, following consultation with the referee, allowing it.  After that, deflated and on tired legs, the West Germans allowed Hurst the run of the pitch as jubilant England supporters made their way over the advertising hoardings. British commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme summed it up when he uttered the famous line: \"Some people are on the pitch. They think it's all over,\" as the unlikely hat-trick hero Hurst hammered home a fourth for England. \"It is now!\" Wolstenholme concluded.  The fourth goal put the match beyond West Germany for good, sealing the Jules Rimet trophy for England, on home soil for the first and only time.  Which defining World Cup moment stands out for you? Have your say on our Facebook page or by tweeting @CNNSport 1970: Pel\u00e9's wild celebration sets the tone against Italy It's perhaps the most enduring image of the World Cup, and so it is fitting that Edson Arantes do Nascimento -- better known as Pel\u00e9, perhaps the one player best associated with the competition -- was at the heart of it.  In the final against Italy in Mexico City, Pel\u00e9, playing in his third World Cup final, leaped to meet a long cross from Rivelino, and seemed to hang in front of the goal, before powerfully heading home at the far post.  It was the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o's 100th World Cup goal, and opened the scoring in what would ultimately be a 4-1 rout of Italy.  The No. 10, widely considered the best player ever to grace the game, spun around in blind joy before jumping in the air and getting enveloped in a bear hug by Jairzinho.  High off the ground, he pumps his fist three times in the air, grinning broadly, before being mobbed by teammates as he set his Brazil team -- also generally thought one of the best units to have graced the competition -- on their way to a third Jules Rimet trophy, with second-half goals from Gerson, Jairzinho and Carlos Alberto.  Pel\u00e9's legacy was secured. 1974: Cruyff turns on the magic Football's a team sport, but every so often there's a moment of individual brilliance that makes the whole stadium -- and watching world -- emit a collective gasp.  So was the case in Dortmund in 1974, in a group game against Sweden. Johan Cruyff, the mercurial Dutchman, bamboozled his opponent with a mind-bending dummy that would come to bear his name -- the Cruyff turn.  Expertly trapping the ball from a lofted forward pass, the Dutch genius faced Swedish defender Jan Olsson just outside the penalty box. In an instant, he faked out the Swede, dragging the ball behind his standing leg and pirouetting away from the defender and toward the goal.  Olsson remained rooted to the spot, struggling to stay upright, no doubt thinking what was going through the minds of everyone else in the stadium and watching: \"What the hell just happened?\" The move came to nothing on the day, but came to define the genius of a Dutch team whose high-concept \"Total Football\" philosophy came to revolutionize the sport. Cruyff scored three goals in the 1974 World Cup, twice against Argentina in the second round and then against Brazil in a 2-0 win that sent Holland through to the final where they were beaten by hosts Germany. 1982: Schumacher foul on Battiston  The World Cup can give us moments of sublime beauty, but it has plenty of capacity for ugliness, too.  One of these less lauded moments came in the 1982 semifinal between France and West Germany -- a game that will forever be remembered for the jarring moment when French substitute Patrick Battiston was floored by German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher.  Midway through the second half Battiston, through on goal following a raking pass from Michel Platini, had only Schumacher to beat when he was flattened by the German keeper, who was racing out of his box to claim the ball. The midair collision left the Frenchman flat out on the turf, unconscious. The ball skipped harmlessly wide as players crowded around his inert form, before he was stretchered off.  The German, who avoided seeing a red card and has since atoned for the incident, stood off to the side, stretching, while the Frenchman was carted from the field. The perceived lack of interest in his opponent's well-being enraged French fans, who jeered at the keeper's  every subsequent involvement in the match.  The knockout game ended 3-3 on a raucous night in Seville, with Germany advancing only after a nervy penalty shootout against a French contingent still shook from the horror clash. 1986 El Diego's \"Hand of God\" -- and the Goal of the Century' Even apostates who have forsaken the beautiful game know about the infamous \"Hand of God\" incident.  At the Mexico World Cup, at a time when tensions were running high between Argentina and England following the conflict over the Falkland Islands -- known in Argentina as the Islas Malvinas -- the stage was set for a fiery encounter.  Add in the bombastic, barrel-chested genius of Diego Maradona and a quarter-final against the English was always going to be incident-packed. And so it came to pass.  Following a frantic, bed-tempered first half in which both sides spurned chances, Maradona saw an opening a few minutes after the restart. A mis-hit clearance was heading toward earth and the hands of England goalkeeper Peter Shilton when the diminutive Argentine No. 10, already at full steam, leaped to meet the ball, punching it clear of Shilton and into the net.  An aghast England squad besieged the referee, Ali Bin Nasser of Tunisia, but the controversial opener stood.  Minutes later, almost in penance for the blatant display of cheating, Maradona slalomed through much of the England team and rounded Shilton to produce a piece of sublime individual skill that, to this day, is widely considered the World Cup's finest goal.  England managed to claw one back but it was too little, too late, and Maradona's two very different strikes advanced the Albiceleste to the semis, and, ultimately, World Cup glory.  1990: Roger Milla's celebration Italia '90 was one of the classiest editions of the World Cup, and was definitely improved by the stylish, hip-swinging celebrations of Cameroonian legend Roger Milla.  Prior to his joyous, finger-raised dance at the corner flag or in front of the fans, goal celebrations tended to be wild, unstructured affairs.  But for Milla's four goals for Cameroon in the competition, in a run that took the West Africans to the quarterfinals -- as far as any African team had ever made it at that time -- Milla injected class and humor into his one-man tango rendition. The run took in a Group B opening game victory over defending champions Argentina, and a last-16 win over Colombia, in which Milla, the undoubted star of the Cameroonian team -- if not the tournament as a whole -- dispossessed another enduring character of the tournament, goalkeeper Ren\u00e9 Higuita, to score a second in extra time.  1994: Escobar's fateful own goal  Another reminder that the World Cup is just as capable of doling out pain as it is joy is the 1994 own goal by Colombian Andr\u00e9s Escobar. The mistake led to his country's elimination from the tournament and, ultimately, his murder, and stands out as a tragic departure from an otherwise exciting tournament in the US.  On July 2, only six days after returning to his home nation, Escobar was gunned down in the streets of Medell\u00edn, in what is likely Colombian football's darkest hour. The killing was linked to drug lords who had suffered big gambling losses because of Colombia's exit at the group stage but nothing was ever proven. Cartel bodyguard Humberto Castro Mu\u00f1oz confessed to the murder, but it is widely speculated that he did not act alone and was employed by a cartel that lost significant money betting on Colombia. As recently as the last edition of the World Cup, in Brazil, tributes still poured in from family, fans and former teammates.  \"Andr\u00e9s Escobar -- always in our hearts,\" wrote Colombia's most capped international -- Escobar's former teammate, Carlos Valderrama -- on Twitter. \"We'll never forget your kindness, your humility and your fight. I miss you bro, I miss you.\" 1998: Bergkamp's moment of genius The stage: Holland's quarterfinal against Argentina, in Marseilles' Stade Velodrome. It's 1-1, approaching the final whistle.  As extra time beckons, from far inside the Dutch half, Frank de Boer pumps a high, long ball forward, expertly finding the outstretched right foot of Dutch master Dennis Bergkamp in the Argentine penalty area.  The Arsenal legend stops it dead, transferring it to his left foot as he twists past Roberto Ayala. His third touch, again with his right boot, flicks it past Carlos Roa, the keeper; three perfect touches to take the ball from a speculative punt upfield to what remains one of the ultimate moments of skill ever displayed in a World Cup. It remains the mathematician-like Bergkamp's favorite goal, from a long, storied career. Years later, he was still able to break it down step by step in an interview with football magazine FourFourTwo. \"How did I do it? First, there's eye contact with Frank de Boer -- he's going to give the ball. Then: sprint away, get six yards away from the defender. The ball is coming over my shoulder.  \"I run in a straight line, jump up to meet the ball, kill it dead. The second touch turns inside, to make sure Ayala is gone, and get a better angle on goal. I aim for the far post and let it curve in.\" Bergkamp's cool demeanor on-field for Arsenal and Holland earned him the nickname \"the Iceman,\" a stark contrast to how one Dutch commentator greeted his spectacular piece of skill that day: \"Dennis Bergkamp! Dennis Bergkamp! Dennis Bergkamp! Dennis Bergkamp! Dennis Bergkamp! Ahhhhhh!\"  2006: Coup de Boule Eight years after their triumph in Paris, the French found themselves back in another final. This one, however, would end in a very different manner.  Zinedine Zidane, hero of the 1998 run, was aging and had publicly declared that the match in Berlin that July evening would be his last, after earlier reversing a pledge of retirement.  As was the case in the Euro 2000 final, France's opponent was Italy, and the match got interesting early when Zidane stepped up to the penalty spot after teammate Florent Malouda was brought down. With a nonchalant chip, he beat the sprawling Gigi Buffon to open the scoring.  Marco Materazzi brought it back level just a few minutes later, and the score would remain even until the end of 120 minutes. But it was the Italian scorer who set in motion a dramatic set of events that led to the French talisman Zidane's dismissal.  Walking back to the center of the pitch, the Italian can be seen mouthing something to the French captain. Zidane walks on, then pauses, evidently reconsidering his reaction. He turns and then, lowering his head like a bull, rams the Italian squarely in the chest. Cue a downed, writhing Materazzi, and a red card for Zidane in his very final match.  Italy went on to win the penalty shootout 5-3. Sadly, the image of the tournament is a toss-up between the moment of impact, and the sight of Zidane, unquestionably the player of his generation, walking past the World Cup, which he was destined never to hold aloft again.  2010: Su\u00e1rez handball  Sometimes, you have to do whatever it takes to win -- just ask Maradona. Another infamous handball entered World Cup lore in the 2010 edition of the competition, when Uruguay met Ghana in the quarterfinals in South Africa.  As the game ticked on to extra time, against the droning backdrop of thousands of vuvuzelas, Uruguayan star Luis Su\u00e1rez found himself face to face with an almost-certain goal headed by Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah after the ball had ping-ponged around the penalty area following a free kick.  So what did the striker do? Standing on the goal line, he instinctively stuck out a hand, swatting the ball away and into the grateful hands of Fernando Muslera, Uruguay's keeper.  Despite a shrug and a \"who me?\" Su\u00e1rez knew he was bang to rights and took his marching orders.  He left the pitch, leaving the Uruguayans a man down but, crucially, not a goal down. Asamoah Gyan, distracted and flustered, whacked the resulting penalty off the bar as Su\u00e1rez, from the tunnel, performed a fist-pumping celebration worthy of an extra-time winner.  After that, the Ghanaians' concentration was shot. Betrayal etched on their faces, they could only watch as Uruguay outclassed them in the resulting penalty shootout, advancing to the next round at the Africans' expense.  2014: Brazil's car-crash collapse When Brazil was selected to host the 2014 World Cup, it was supposed to be a celebration of \"jogo bonito\" -- the beautiful game. After 64 years, football was finally coming home.  But the tournament met significant resistance on the streets of the host nation, as citizens protested the price of an extravagant tournament while the country languished and public utilities rotted.  That malaise carried itself onto the pitch. Following a promising start in its opener against Croatia, the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o failed to produce any real glittering form. Even a 4-1 victory over Cameroon lacked the kind of flair and verve that Brazilians have come to expect from their national team, but under coach Luiz Felipe Scolari they limped to a semifinal against Germany. And that's where it all truly fell apart. It started ominously that evening at the Estadio Mineir\u00e3o in Belo Horizonte, with Thomas M\u00fcller opening the scoring after 11 minutes. Twelve minutes later it was 2-0. Then 3-0, then 4-0. A punch-drunk Brazil were an incredible 5-0 down after 30 minutes, and unable even really to comprehend what was happening as the sixth and seventh went in, courtesy of Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle, as the game wound up.  A solitary, final act of defiance arrived in the form of an injury-time goal from Oscar but by then the damage -- to the team, and the nation's psyche -- was complete.  Unsurprisingly, four days later, the devastated players completely capitulated in the third-place playoff match against the Netherlands, and their humiliation, on home turf, was finally complete.

{"content": "CNN Australia affiliate Seven News reported that the network's Europe correspondent, Laurel Irving, and cameraman Jimmy Cannon were finishing up a live broadcast Wednesday night local time when they were accosted by two men wearing ski masks.  One demanded the camera, telling Cannon that he had a gun concealed in his pocket. \"They came up immediately and they were wearing masks so I knew something was going on. Before he came over, I saw him reach into his pants and transfer something from his pants,\" Cannon told Seven's Sunrise program. \"He said, 'Hey, I have a gun in my jacket, don't make a scene.'\" The incident happened around 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET) Wednesday in the affluent London suburb of Islington.  Footage from a dashcam shows the two men approaching Cannon. Momentarily distracted, Irving tells the camera that there is a disturbance. The $19,000 (A$25,000) camera is then removed from its tripod -- while still filming -- and taken by the robbers.  Irving, who tried to intervene before being told by Cannon to let the robbers take the camera, called the mugging \"brazen.\"  \"We were in an upmarket area, surrounded by restaurants and cafes and it was not that late. Thousands of buses were going past but these guys pulled it off,\" she said. Neither Irving nor Cannon was harmed during the incident, a Seven representative said. Irving later tweeted her appreciation for viewers' concern, and praised her colleague.  \"Thanks everyone for the love. We're all good,\" the tweet reads. \"(Cannon) was fantastic. The London crime rate though is crazy.\" London Metropolitan Police statistics show a total of 47,587 thefts from people were reported in the 2017-18 financial year, a 25% increase over the previous year.  Just days before the Seven crew was robbed it emerged that British actor Benedict Cumberbatch fought off a group of assailants attempting to mug a delivery cyclist. Cumberbatch, 41, reportedly jumped out of his Uber cab to help a cyclist from the food delivery company Deliveroo, who was being attacked by a group of would-be muggers in central London. In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police said a cyclist in his 20s was making a delivery when four men pounced on him and punched him in the face in an attempt to take his bike. The incident reportedly happened in November, but only came to light recently, according to British tabloid the Sun. The paper also reported that British comedian Michael McIntyre was mugged by a pair of knife- and hammer-wielding assailants as he dropped his young son off at school earlier in June.

It was six hours before the blaze was brought under control, the London Fire Brigade said. Thirty-six hotel guests and 250 hotel staff were evacuated, it said. The hotel group said it believed that everyone in the building at the time of the fire had been accounted for. The London Ambulance Service said Wednesday night that multiple crews had been sent to the scene but no one had required treatment. First reports of the blaze emerged just before 4 p.m. Plumes of thick, black smoke were seen billowing into the air above Hyde Park as the fire took hold. Traffic in the area -- home to luxury stores Harvey Nichols and Harrods  -- was brought to a standstill. \"Firefighters worked extremely hard in exceptionally hot conditions to bring the fire under control,\" said London Fire Brigade station manager Pam Oparaocha, who was at the scene.  The fire service said the blaze had damaged the hotel's \"planting facade\" and affected parts of the roof and several floors. As part of the recent renovation, the hotel had installed \"living walls\" -- plants attached to the facade of a building -- in an interior courtyard.  A woman who had been in the hotel praised the evacuation. \"Just evacuated Mandarin Oriental hotel to see this ... absolutely crazy!\" wrote Anna Whiteley on Twitter. \"So impressed by the organisation in bringing everyone to safety.\" The Mandarin hotel group said guests had been accommodated at other nearby hotels. \"We would like to thank the emergency services for their swift response, and are working closely with them to ensure the safety of the building,\" the group said in a statement.  \"It is too early at the present stage to assess the full extent of the damage. A full investigation is underway and will take time to complete,\" it added. The fire service said it would remain at the scene for most of Thursday. The Mandarin had recently been undergoing a major refurbishment of its 181 guest rooms and suites. In a news release announcing the completion of the project last week, the Mandarin said the rooms were \"now more luxurious and comfortable than ever before.\" The largest suites, due to launch in July, offered \"expansive views of leafy Hyde Park and the London skyline.\" The hotel was built in 1889 and first opened as an exclusive gentleman's club, according to the group's website. Ten years later, a fire damaged the top three floors of one wing and destroyed a section of the roof. It was reopened in 1902 as a luxury hotel.

Striker Neymar was sidelined with a vertebra injury for the match which took place in front of a devastated home crowd in Belo Horizonte. But with the Paris Saint-Germain superstar fully fit, along with the emergence of goalscorers Gabriel Jesus and Philippe Coutinho, Brazil has lost just four international matches since and only once in the past two years.  Gracenote's predictions place Brazil first, giving the team a 21% chance of lifting the trophy. It ranks Spain second, Germany third, and Argentina fourth going into Russia.  FIFA rankings, which are slightly less data-driven, have Germany ranked first, with Brazil, Belgium and Portugal ranked second, third and fourth, respectively. British oddsmakers William Hill tips Brazil as the favorite with 4/1 odds, Germany second at 9/2 and Spain third at 6/1. The matchup most likely for the July 15 final in Moscow is Brazil vs. Spain at 3.8%, with Brazil vs. Germany only slightly less likely at 3.7%., according to Gracenote.

There is a 31% chance that either Brazil or Germany -- both heavy favorites to win their first-round groups -- finish group runner-up, forcing a second-round knockout matchup between the two powers, according to Gracenote.  Argentina, the 2014 runner-up, and 2010 winner Spain will face each other as early as the quarterfinasl if both teams win their groups. Should France top its group, however, it will not meet another winner of the previous 12 World Cups until the semifinals. Gracenote Sports' head of analytics Simon Gleave explains that injured players like Mohamed Salah of Egypt are not factored into team odds, nor are players returning from suspension like Peru captain Paolo Guerrero Gleave identifies Peru -- which has qualified for the first time since 1982 -- as a surprise Group C challenger to France, noting that the South Americans are unbeaten in the past 14 matches.  \"They would be my pick as a dark horse,\" he says, \"certainly given that the chance that we give them is somewhat better than the chance that the (oddsmakers) give them.\" Gracenote assigns a whopping 68% chance of Peru progressing in its group, which also features Denmark and Australia. It stands a 39% chance of reaching the quarterfinals, and a 22% chance of going all the way to the semis. William Hill pays 7/4 odds of Peru advancing from the group, 9/1 to reach the quarterfinals and 33/1 to reach the semis.  Gleave notes that Peru's stats are not aided by a home-field altitude advantage, because their World Cup qualifying matches were played in Lima on the country's coastline.  \"It's what everyone asks me about Peru,\" he says. Results from the 2016 Rio Olympics' football tournament -- where a redemptive Brazil defeated Germany in penalties for gold -- are also not factored, says Gleave.  Though that match featured Neymar scoring a wonderous free-kick and winning penalty, the mostly Under-23 teams were not counted as full international matches. Gracenote's statistics are based on team ratings, which factor in match results, location, and importance (friendlies are given low weightings). A predictive algorithm is then run over one million times, producing estimates for each team's chances of advancing in the tournament. All that number crunching has some merit. Last year Gracenote ran the same algorithm before the start of the Champions League, correctly predicting that Real Madrid had the best chance of winning at 30%.  Like the World Cup, the Champions League featured 32 teams at the start of the competition. However, the gulf of talent between the strongest and weakest teams in the Champions League is higher than it is in the World Cup, says Gleave. \"There's a lot of very weak teams in the Champions League,\" he explains. \"The champion of a country like Slovenia is not going to be at the level of even some of the weakest teams in the World Cup.\" Mourinho's World Cup magic? One experienced football mind who does not share Gleave's enthusiasm for Peru is Jose Mourinho. The Manchester United manager, speaking as a guest host on Russian TV broadcaster RT, chose Australia as Group C runner-up behind France, despite Gracenote assigning just a 27% chance for the Socceroos to advance.  Mourinho also picked two African countries as tournament surprises. He chose Nigeria to advance from difficult group D over Iceland and Croatia, and Senegal to win Group H, despite an 18% statistical chance to finish above Poland, Colombia and Japan. No African team has finished first in the group stage since Nigeria in 1998, according to Gracenote. Should an African team reach the semifinals, it would be a first. Three have been knocked out in the quarterfinals; most recently Senegal in 2002.  Mourinho picked his own country, Euro 2016 winners Portugal, to finish behind Spain in Group B.  \"I am going to show later that I am totally Portuguese, but we are going to finish second in the group,\" he said, not yet revealing his picks beyond the group stage.    Without naming former Barcelona rival Lionel Messi, Mourinho gave Argentina a nod to advance. \"In group D, I think the 'little fellow' will finish first,\" he said. Finally, Mourinho appeared to be choosing with both heart and head when he picked higher-ranked Switzerland to advance in Group E over Serbia, who feature Manchester United defensive midfielder Nemanja Matic. \"This is going to be tough,\" he said. \"I'm sorry Nemanja, but you need a holiday.\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/07/football/world-cup-russia-2018-predictor-brazil-spt/index.html", "description": "Brazil is the statistical favorite to win the World Cup in Russia, but there is a 35% chance that it will have to beat tournament nemesis Germany along the way.

{"content": "But the 36-year-old -- whose contract was terminated by US Soccer in 2016 for \"conduct that is counter to the organization's principles\" -- has told CNN Sport she'd prefer the 2026 tournament to be awarded to a \"more deserving country\" than her homeland, which is jointly bidding with Mexico and Canada.   North America is up against Morocco to earn the right to host soccer's showpiece event in 2026, with a decision to be made on June 13 in Moscow -- the eve of the 2018 World Cup in Russia -- when up to 207 national associations at a FIFA congress will decide in a public vote who will host the tournament in eight years. Under the North America proposal, 60 games in 2026 would be held in the US -- which last hosted a World Cup in 1994 -- including everything from the quarterfinals onwards, while Mexico and Canada would host 10 games each.  READ: 11 moments that shook the World Cup READ: And the winner of the World Cup is...  Admitting that her feelings on the matter were mixed, Solo told CNN Sport in an exclusive interview: \"I think any time you host a World Cup you're going to have new generations of soccer fans and that's important. It's important especially in a younger country like America. \"It's important for so many different reasons, I want to go myself to the World Cup in America. \"But, at the same time, I think it should be awarded to a country which abides by federal law, who is transparent, who runs their non-profit organizations in the way it should be run, who aren't hiding millions of dollars, and a company who actually answers these questions that want to be answered. They just ignore everybody.\" \"They\" are the US Soccer Federation (USSF), the body that runs football in the States and is one of the driving forces behind the North American bid. \"I do have a problem with an organization like that being awarded something so big and I would like to think there's another country out there who is more deserving than the United States,\" continued Solo, who was voted the outstanding goalkeeper of the past two women's World Cups and is only the third female goalkeeper in history to win both a World Cup and Olympic gold. \"Of course, I want to see the World Cup in America. But I also want to see an organization that stands true to the promises that they made to all of the delegates, to all of the members. \"But, right now, they've neglected so many people of the membership. If they get the bid, they make more money and they don't answer to anybody so it goes back to the power structure.\"   The sport of 'rich white kids' The \"hidden millions\" Solo refers to is the $150 million surplus in US Soccer's coffers.  The goalkeeper has not played for the US since she was suspended for six months and had her contract terminated after calling Sweden's team a \"bunch of cowards\" following their defeat of the US at Rio 2016. She also ran, unsuccessfully, for the Presidency of US Soccer in February. The Washington native thinks the sport's governing body in the States should spend the money helping young players from poorer backgrounds by ending \"pay-to-play,\" for instance, a widespread practice of elite clubs charging parents to coach young players. Solo, who spoke to CNN Sport in London at the Foundation for Sports Integrity's inaugural conference, describes the men's inability to qualify for this summer's World Cup in Russia as \"unacceptable but not surprising\" and argues that the federation's failure to nurture young talent from all backgrounds has made the sport in her country the reserve of \"rich white kids.\" US Soccer is a non-profit organization which is required by US law, it says, to use its money to help grassroots soccer.  Pointing out that US Soccer's financial statements were available online, the federation told CNN Sport that the \"vast majority of revenue that US Soccer generates is invested back into player, coach and referee development.\"   READ: Who is really to blame for Hope Solo's fall? Moroccan bid high risk? The potential impact of Donald Trump administration's policies, including attempts to implement a travel ban on residents of six majority-Muslim countries, has caused problems for the North American bid, though the team has offered guarantees to FIFA that there will be no discrimination around entry for the tournament. Morocco's bid, however, hasn't been without its problems either.  In an evaluation report, FIFA's inspectors awarded North America a significantly higher score than Morocco, with the North African bid deemed \"high risk\" in three areas because of a lack of infrastructure to host the 80-game tournament.  FIFA's evaluation of the Morocco bid also raised concerns about the potential treatment of the LGBT community. \"There is a risk of discrimination based on sexual orientation as a consequence of the country's legislation on the matter,\" said the FIFA assessment. Morocco has said it needs to spend almost $16 billion (\u00a312 billion) on infrastructure while the North American bid's revenue forecast ($14.3bn) far outstrips what Morocco has to offer ($7.2bn). Regarding sexual orientation, the North American bid pledged to use its leverage to reduce the risk of discrimination and harassment in Mexico and the US in particular.

{"content": "French President Emmanuel Macron signaled earlier this year that action would be taken to limit the spread of fake news after alleged Russian interference during last year's French presidential campaign. However, critics say the proposed laws threaten freedom of expression and could give the government undue control over information. Deputies in the National Assembly are considering two proposals put forward by Macron's party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, one applying to any election and the other specifically to presidential elections. The proposed legislation would allow election candidates and parties to call upon a judge to put a stop to the diffusion of \"false information\" during the three-month run-up to a national election -- particularly on social media. It could allow judges to close down or block websites that are ruled to be disseminating fake news. They would be able to pass judgments within 48 hours as to whether \"false information\" could have an impact on the elections. The law would also authorize the French media council to take foreign state-controlled broadcasters off the air if they were attempting to destabilize France -- a measure seen as directed at Russian state news outlets. Following debate, the National Assembly will vote on the legislation Thursday evening. If it passes, it will then go to Senate to be debated and voted on before it is signed into law.  France is not alone in expressing concern about potential Russian interference in election campaigning. Russia has also been accused of trying to influence votes in Britain and Germany. Meanwhile, investigations continue in the US into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Macron held talks with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg last month in Paris as part of the President's efforts to tackle the use of social media to spread fake news. Zuckerberg also testified before the European Parliament. 'Crude attempt to control information' Naima Moutchou, a lawmaker for La R\u00e9publique En Marche who helped draft the bill, dismissed criticism Thursday, telling radio station Europe 1 that there were various safeguards in the bill \"allowing the protection of liberty and expression.\" Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told the France Inter radio station that the proposed laws would allow the electorate \"to better exercise democracy.\"  However, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, a leading figure of the far left and head of the France Unbowed party, wrote on his website that the bill represented a \"crude attempt to control information.\" Lawmaker \u00c9ric Ciotti, of the opposition Republican party, tweeted that the law put forward by La R\u00e9publique En Marche \"carries great dangers for our democracy\" and that he would vote against it. \"The idea of 'verifiable facts' opens the way to a particularly dangerous 'official truth,'\" he said. France's National Union of Journalists described the law as \"liberticide\" in a statement published in March. \"The law threatens freedom of expression and freedom to inform,\" it said. \"This law which says it wants to protect against the risk of information manipulation during the electoral period could also become a way to threaten the work of professional journalists.\"  International media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which warned the legislation could have \"perverse effects,\" put forward alternative proposals. \"It is understandable and justifiable to try to prevent manipulative content from circulating online, but the solutions proposed in the bill could be unworkable and even counterproductive,\" it said. The editorial board for national broadsheet Le Monde called the law \"useless\" and said French parliamentarians \"seem to have deliberately chosen to compose an ineffective law so that it is not dangerous.\" Alexandre Alaphilippe, executive director of EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based non-profit organization that researches disinformation on social media, was similarly critical. \"It's not up to the judge or the state to decide if information is true or false -- if you go that way, you are basically losing control of the narrative,\" he told CNN. Instead, he said, it should be up to civil society, in the form of journalists, fact-checkers, non-governmental groups and academics, to monitor and check information -- and, crucially, to expose the sources of disinformation and analyze how people spread it via social media. \"As long as you don't understand what is going on on the platforms and how these information campaigns are being spread, pretty much everything you do is useless,\" said Alaphilippe. Meanwhile, he said, the platforms have been reluctant to give researchers access to their data. Another risk is that authoritarian leaders could seek to use the French law as a model in their own countries in order to stifle free speech, he added. \"We should think about how we would feel if the same thing was applied in Africa, North Korea, Turkey,\" he said. \"We would say it was against freedom of expression, democracy.\" Safeguards promised The French Culture Ministry argued the case for the new legislation in a statement posted online Thursday, saying that while disinformation was nothing new, the change in the scale and pace of its dissemination, enabled by digital platforms, made it a threat to democracy. \"Fake news spreads up to six times faster than verified information,\" said Culture Minister Francoise Nyssen. \"Therefore it does more damage than before.\" The ministry insisted that the law would not impinge on freedom of expression or the protection of journalists' sources. It also said the legislation would afford greater protections than leaving digital platforms to censor their own content, without explaining their criteria, and that rapid actions would be allowed only during an election period and in a very controlled manner. Speaking to the media earlier this year, Macron said the planned legislation would largely target social media. If people wanted \"to protect liberal democracies, we must have strong legislation,\" he said. Macron was the target of a \"massive and coordinated hacking operation\" that was intended to undermine him in the final days before the election last year, his campaign said at the time. US officials also pointed to Russian interference. Russia denied any involvement. Soon after the election, Macron raised the issue in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in France, accusing two Russian state-financed media outlets -- RT and Sputnik -- of spreading \"lies\" during his presidential run against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/07/europe/france-fake-news-law-intl/index.html", "description": "French lawmakers debated legislation Thursday that is intended to limit the spread of fake news and disinformation during election periods.

{"content": "The London Metropolitan Police will determine whether the advice to residents to stay in their apartments while the blaze tore up the tower's 24 floors broke health and safety laws, the Met's Det. Supt. Matt Bonner said. \"The LFB would, as any other organization involved, have an obligation to conduct their activity in a manner that doesn't place people at risk. It doesn't mean that at the moment they have or they haven't, but that's where the legislation is most likely to arise if that was an eventuality,\" Bonner told reporters Thursday, the Press Association reported. The fire brigade's response to the June 14 fire last year has come under increased scrutiny, as a public inquiry into the event is underway. Fire safety expert Barbara Lane expressed concern Monday that it took nearly two hours for the fire brigade to change the stay put policy, even though it had \"effectively failed\" after around half an hour. Britain typically uses a passive approach to fire response, in which firefighters try to compartmentalize a blaze, while residents stay in their apartments, usually fitted with doors and materials that protect them from smoke and fire outside. In a report submitted to the inquiry, Lane found several issues in Grenfell Tower that would have prevented firefighters from carrying out their response effectively, including a non-functioning fire lift, a ventilation system that \"did not operate as intended,\" and a non-compliant fire main that prevented more water getting up to higher levels.  She also found that all the apartment doors, including more than 100 replaced in 2011, were non-compliant with fire safety regulations, and that stairway fire doors had not been replaced since 1972 and did not meet current benchmarks. Some of these failings meant corridors and stairways were filled with smoke and fire, hampering both evacuation and response. The material used to clad the tower was later found to be highly combustible and allowed for the fire's rapid spread upwards. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) and the Fire Brigades Union both defended their response on Thursday in the inquiry. A lawyer for the LFB, Stephen Walsh, urged the inquiry to keep in mind that the firefighters \"will have been wholly unaware of defects in the fabric of the building from a fire safety perspective.\" The union's Martin Seaward said while there was concern over the stay put policy, there was \"no obvious and safe alternative strategy\" to deal with the fire and asked the inquiry not to be swayed by the \"benefit of hindsight.\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/07/uk/grenfell-fire-brigade-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "description": "Police are investigating the London Fire Brigade's \"stay put\" advice during the Grenfell Tower fire last year, in which 72 people were killed, the Press Association reports.", "title": "Grenfell fire: Police probe fire brigade's 'stay put' advice", "author": "Angela Dewan, CNN", "date": "2018-06-07 17:40:31"},

I've still got a long way to go, there will be rocky times and it can't all by rosy.\" Smith always knew she was different from the age of four or five but, as she puts it, \"I couldn't quite put my finger on it.\" The idea she wanted to be a girl gnawed away at her but, \"I think it took longer to accept it as I was attracted to females.\" Smith had a series of long-term relationships with women, relationships that \"put it to the back of my mind, suppressed it really.\" But increasingly, Smith would be attracted by women as much by their looks as enviously eying their clothes, jewelry and make-up. READ: Boston Marathon's inclusion of transgender athletes 'If I don't do this, I'll die unhappy' Yet in the often macho world of horse racing, she felt too nervous to make her secret public until last year. Partially inspired by Caitlyn Jenner and Kellie Maloney, who both transitioned from the \"male-dominated sports worlds\" of the decathlon and boxing respectively, helped instil a bit more confidence in Smith. \"I'd also lost a couple of friends along the way and I thought to myself 'if I don't do this, I'll die unhappy,'\" she added. \"There's still a long way to go but I'm as happy as hell.\" The first and hardest conversation was with her parents. \"That's the main backbone for help and acceptance,\" she said. \"If you haven't got your family behind you -- and lots of my transgender friends don't -- it's a big kick in the teeth. \"I knew my mother would be fine really and she was just upset I'd kept it to myself for so long. My dad was great too, telling my mother 'you'd always wanted a daughter!' \"If your family accept it, it makes it easier for other people too and it's sort of snowballed from there.\" His former jockey friends, among them Graham Bradley, Richard Dunwoody and Steve Smith Eccles, have all been accepting.

But, as she puts it \"two or three out of 1,500 people isn't bad.\" She added: \"People that are transitioning are not sick, they're just normal people. Once people speak to me, they realize I'm just the same person.\" 'I guess that makes me a lesbian' The name Victoria was an easy pick, one she'd potentially earmarked for a daughter, and she has been taking hormone medication for the past year. Having initially been reticent about it, she is committed to full gender reassignment surgery in the years to come although her transitioning is still in its early days. \"It used to be confusing as why did I feel female but was in a male body and fancied females,\" she said. \"It's a little bit difficult to understand myself so I can understand it's tricky for others.

Netanyahu said other methods had been tried, but didn't work. The Israeli leader was in London as part of a tour of Germany, France and the UK capitals during which he has attempted to persuade European leaders to ease their support for the Iran nuclear deal. He faced questions on a range of issues at an event in London organized by the Policy Exchange think tank. Howard, a prominent Jewish figure in British politics who is now a member of the House of Lords, said that many would understand the need to prevent protesters scaling the border fence during violent demonstrations. \"Fewer people ... sympathize and understand the proposition that the only way to stop them scaling the fence was to kill them,\" he added. \"Why couldn't you use rubber bullets? Why couldn't you -- if in extremis you had to use live ammunition -- why couldn't you shoot them in the legs? Why did you have to kill them to stop them scaling the fence?\" Netanyahu responded that everything suggested by Howard had been tried, along with other methods, but that they hadn't worked. \"Nobody intentionally went out to kill anyone,\" he said. The Israeli leader pointed the finger at Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, saying it had wanted more Palestinian deaths. \"Their goal was to have as many casualties. Our goal was to minimize casualties and avoid fatalities,\" he said. The questions from Howard came a day after UK Prime Minister Theresa May told Netanyahu that her government was \"concerned\" about the loss of Palestinian lives in Gaza. \"The UK absolutely recognizes that Israel has a right for self defense,\" May said during an on-camera conversation in Downing Street, but added that she hoped Israel could alleviate the \"deteriorating\" situation in Gaza.  Responding, Netanyahu said the issue was \"rooted in the fundamental goal of Hamas to destroy Israel.\"  \"This is not a non-violent protest, quite the contrary,\" Netanyahu said, referring to the Palestinian Great March of Return, a series of Friday demonstrations over six weeks from March to May. More than 100 Palestinian protesters were killed by Israeli fire during the protests, according to a CNN count based on Palestinian Health Ministry figures. Netanyahu said the Israelis were doing \"everything we can\" to minimize civilian casualties, \"and at the same time protect Israeli lives.\" Israel faced international condemnation last month after Israeli forces killed dozens of Palestinians in bloody clashes at the Gaza border as the US officially opened its Embassy in Jerusalem just 50 miles away. The Israeli Defence Forces, or IDF, said protesters were trying to storm the border fence between Israel and Gaza. It accused Hamas of \"leading a terrorist operation\" and inciting the protesters to conduct what Israel described as terror attacks. Palestinian leaders said the protests were peaceful and the use of force was wholly disproportionate to the threat. The aim of the March of Return movement is to highlight the Palestinian right to return to homes and villages lost by their ancestors in the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war.

But a narrow majority of the seven-strong panel of justices were of \"clear opinion\" that the current legislation is \"incompatible\" with Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights in cases of fatal fetal abnormality, rape and incest, but not serious fetal abnormality.  The Deputy President of the Supreme Court, Lord Jonathan Hugh Mance, said that \"the present law clearly needs radical reconsideration.\"  NIHRC told the court in October that the current law criminalizes women and girls, subjecting them to \"inhuman and degrading\" treatment. It had asked the court to rule on whether it was unlawful to prohibit abortions that arise from sexual crimes or cases involving \"a serious fetal abnormality.\" After the Irish republic's overwhelming abortion referendum result in late May, Northern Ireland is now the only area of the British Isles where termination is only permitted if there is a risk to the woman's life or if there are long-term or permanent threats to a woman's mental or physical health.  The republic's constitutional reform had spurred questions over whether there should be a similar change to the law in Northern Ireland. Decisions on abortion law are the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly, but it has been suspended for more than a year because of a political impasse. But despite the hiatus, the UK government has said it will not intervene on the issue.  The minority government of British Prime Minister Theresa May relies for its survival in the UK parliament on support from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), a deeply conservative party from Northern Ireland that opposes any attempt to ease restrictions on abortion. DUP leader Arlene Foster said last week that the referendum in the republic had \"no impact upon the law in Northern Ireland.\" Pressure falls on UK PM Shortly after the ruling, NIHRC Chief Commissioner Les Allamby said in a statement: \"The highest court in the UK has today agreed with the Commission that Northern Ireland's laws on termination of pregnancy are incompatible with human rights.\" Allamby said that Thursday's proceedings made it clear that Northern Ireland needs to reform its termination laws and called on the UK government to intervene. \"The law now needs to change to stop women and girls from further anxiety and suffering. In the absence of the NI Executive and Assembly it falls to the UK government to make this change and it must act without delay,\" he added.  More than 160 lawmakers, including some Conservatives, have written to May demanding she allow a referendum on relaxing the abortion laws in Northern Ireland.

The data collected from his Team AkzoNobel boat  in the Volvo Ocean Race has found microplastics --  minute pieces of plastic less than five millimeters in diameter -- at a place in the Southern Ocean known as Point Nemo, the furthest place from land on the planet.  It is so remote, the nearest humans are said to be astronauts on the International Space Station. Sehested spends two hours a day during his precious four-hour \"off-watch\" -- when he's not on deck racing the boat -- operating a machine which takes water samples during the 45,000-mile 11-leg around-the-world race. \"If I can sacrifice a bit of sleep and people can stop using single-use plastic and dumping it in the ocean, I think it's all worth it and I'm happy to sleep after the race,\" he told CNN Sport by phone from a race stopover in Newport, RI. \"It's not taking any of my time sailing the boat, it's just taking half of my off watch but it's for a good cause, right?\" READ: Gonet Monofoil -- revolutionary 'flying' yacht takes off Plastic pollution in the oceans is a hot topic on the environmental agenda. According to the Plastic Oceans website, 550 million plastic straws are thrown away every day in the US and the UK, while worldwide more than 500 million plastic bottles are used every year and more than one trillion plastic bags are discarded. A 2016 report by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) said that if this trend continues at the same rate, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean (by weight) by 2050. According to the Volvo Ocean Race findings, there were between nine and 26 particles of microplastic per cubic metre near Point Nemo. Nearer to Cape Horn, off the tip of South America, measurements increased to 57 particles per cubic meter. As well as polluting the water, microplastics are also ingested by fish, other sealife and birds, and this plastic then re-enters the human food chain to be eaten by us.

The incoming sea water flows through micro-filters which are later analysed by shore-based scientists to determine levels of microplastics, temperature, salinity, CO2 levels and algae content. He takes GPS readings of each sample so analysts can chart water quality around the world.   \"It is a tricky job when it's super windy and there are massive waves,\" adds Sehested, whose Team AkzoNobel crew set a race record for the furthest distance sailed in 24 hours -- 602.51 nautical miles (1,115 kilometers) -- on leg nine from Newport to Cardiff, UK  \"It's not fun to work downstairs with your head down when you should be sleeping -- you can get seasick pretty easily -- but it's important for us and for the race and the future of the race that we do put some focus on this thing.\" READ: 'Weathered but wiser': Around the world sailor learns harsh lessons Dr. Soren Gutekunst of GEOMAR Institute for Ocean Research Kiel, analyzed the samples at a laboratory in Kiel, Germany. \"This is the first ever data that the scientific community has been able to analyse from a relatively inaccessible part of our blue planet,\" he told the race website.   \"Unfortunately, it shows how far and wide microplastics have penetrated our vast oceans and that they are now present in what, until now, many have considered to be untouched, pristine waters.\" The highest levels of microplastic found so far in the race was 357 particles per cubic metre recorded from the South China Sea, east of Taiwan. It's an area that feeds into the Great Pacific Ocean Gyre -- one of the earth's five huge areas of circulating current and winds in which trash gathers. \"In Asia it's pretty much plastic bottles and cups and straws and plastic bags and clothing and you see that every day,\" says Sehested, who made his debut in the biennial Volvo Ocean Race in 2014-2015. \"Back in the day we only saw it in crowded areas like Asia but unfortunately it's now all over the world. We do see plastic in the Southern Ocean -- not as often but maybe once or twice a day.\" READ: Meet the man who sailed around the world in 42 days 'Amazing oceans' Alongside the hard science, Sehested says his crew have noticed a lack of wildlife on their current circumnavigation.  \"We're talking about it more or less every leg, especially the older guys like Chris (Nicholson) and Jules (Salter) who have done the race many times,\" he says.  \"They tell us stories of massive packs of dolphins and whales and other wildlife, but this race we haven't seen much.

The 46-year-old former economics professor, who leads the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, assumed leadership on Saturday, a day after toppling scandal-hit Mariano Rajoy in a no-confidence vote. Just five women served in the last Cabinet under Rajoy.  \"This new government is unequivocally committed to equality. You have heard me say it many times: Spain changed on March 8. There was a before and an after in our country with the feminist mobilizations and the new government is a faithful reflection of that movement,\" Sanchez said Wednesday. On March 8, millions of Spanish women took part in a 24-hour strike aimed at sexual discrimination and gender inequality. Sanchez looked beyond his party in selecting his new ministers including Dolores Delgado -- a state attorney who specialized in the prosecution of jihadist attacks -- as justice minister, Nadia Calvi\u00f1o -- who until recently had been a top EU budget official -- as the economy minister and climate change treaty negotiator Teresa Ribera as environment minister.  Other prominent appointees included Carmen Calvo, who became deputy prime minister and equality minister; former Andalusia councilor Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero as budget minister and Meritxell Batet has been tasked with handling the Catalan independence issue as territory administration minister.

There would be all sorts of breakdowns, there would be all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he'd gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It's a very, very good thought,\" he said. Johnson reportedly made the remarks at a dinner with fellow prominent Conservatives in London on Wednesday. Buzzfeed did not specify how it obtained the audio, and it's unclear if Johnson knew he was being recorded. During his speech, Johnson touched upon everything from Brexit to Russia and the upcoming summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, according to Buzzfeed. The site only published audio that related to Brexit negotiations.  The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Brexit fears are 'total mumbo jumbo' Johnson, who has clashed with May over Britain's approach to Brexit negotiations, also told the audience he feared his government was heading towards a deal that would keep the UK  \"locked in orbit around the EU\" without \"full freedom on our trade policy, our tariff schedules, and not having freedom with our regulatory framework either.\" \"I will be prepared to compromise over time, but I will not compromise over the destination,\" he said. Johnson conceded that there would be bumps in the road during the Brexit process, but chastised those who were worried about the short-term economic downsides and potential turbulence on the UK's borders due to Brexit. A UK government analysis leaked earlier this year suggested that leaving the EU could reduce economic growth by between 2% and 8% over 15 years. \"What they don't want is friction at the border, they don't want any interruption of the economy. So they're sacrificing all the medium- and long-term gains out of fear of short term disruption,\" he said. \"They're terrified of this nonsense. It's all total mumbo jumbo.\" The revelations come at a time of deep divisions at the highest levels of the UK government over Brexit, and as Theresa May arrives to meet fellow world leaders at the G7 summit in Canada.  Johnson has repeatedly run into trouble for off-the-cuff and impolitic remarks. Last year, he was forced to backtrack and apologize after suggesting that a British-Iranian woman being held in Iran was teaching journalists when she was arrested.

{"content": "The measures mark the first time the country's controversial \"law on Islam\" -- introduced in 2015 when current Chancellor Sebastian Kurz was foreign minister -- is being invoked.  The imams and mosques being targeted are suspected of breaching a rule that bans the foreign funding of Islamic communities.  \"Austria is a land of diversity, where religious freedom is highly valued, but it is also clear that we are a constitutional state where statutory rules are needed to organize our coexistence,\" Kurz said Friday. \"Parallel societies, political Islam and radicalization have no place in our country.\" Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, whose anti-immigrant, anti-Islam Freedom Party is currently in a coalition government with Kurz's conservative People's Party, said the crackdown on \"dubious finance flows\" was \"just the beginning\" of the fight against \"radical political Islam.\" Critics warn that the measures indicate an Islamophobic attitude in Austria's new government, formed last December. Turkish government spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Friday on Twitter that the government's \"ideologically charged practices are in violation of universal legal principles, social integration policies, minority rights and the ethics of co-existence.\" A society that runs a mosque linked with the \"Grey Wolves,\" a nationalist Turkish organization, will be shut down along with an Arab Muslim group that runs at least six mosques.  Austria's Office of Religious Affairs -- which has recently seen its powers expanded -- will oversee the process.  The 60 imams affected are all connected to the Turkish Islamic Cultural Association (ATIB). They could be expelled from the country or have their visas denied on the grounds of allegedly receiving foreign funding.  Including family members, 150 people could be affected, according to Interior Minister Herbert Kickl. 'Difficult days are ahead' Many of Austria's roughly 700,000 Muslims -- around 8% of the population -- have Turkish roots.  Turkish government spokesman Kalin described the decision as \"a reflection of the Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory wave in this country.\" \"It is an attempt to target Muslim communities for the sake of scoring cheap political points,\" he wrote in a post on Twitter, adding, \"Efforts to normalize Islamophobia and racism must be rejected under all circumstances.\" Mahmut Askar, an ATIB consultant in Cologne and former chairman of ATIB Germany, described the measures as \"shocking.\" \"This is a shame for democracy -- and especially for the Muslims in Europe,\" he told CNN. \"Difficult and bad days are ahead for the Muslim minority in Europe.'' Foreign funding necessary 'to cover deficit' Immigration and Islam dominated last year's election campaign in Austria, with the far-right Freedom Party calling for \"minus migration\" and a ban on \"fascistic Islam.\" Earlier in the year, Kurz's party was the driving force behind a law banning full-face Muslim veils in public spaces. Since the arrival of around 90,000 asylum seekers in 2015, many of whom were Muslim and had fled the war in Syria, the two issues of immigration and Islam have been frequently conflated by right-wing lawmakers.  Enacted in 2015, the country's new law on Islam was criticized by some as discriminatory. Although it guarantees certain protections for Muslims -- including the right to celebrate Islamic holidays and to access halal food in schools and hospitals -- critics pointed out that no other recognized religious groups in Austria face bans on foreign funding.  Defending the law in 2015, Kurz said, \"We don't want any imams who are employees of other governments.\" Speaking to public broadcaster ORF Friday, ATIB's Austria spokesperson confirmed that the organization is financed from abroad but said this was necessary because of the lack of training opportunities for imams in Austria. Imams who had trained in Turkey and now work in Austria would continue to receive funding from Turkey \"to cover the deficit,\" Yasar Ersoy explained.

Pope Francis called the meeting to address a severe shortage of priests in the Amazon basin, which covers more than three million square miles.  The preparatory document, published on Friday, says the resources of the church have been spread too thinly in the region. \"One of the main points to be heard is the cry of thousands of communities deprived of the Sunday Eucharist for long periods of time,\" the document says. It says the church should not be afraid to make \"daring proposals.\" The document does not specifically mention the proposal to allow married men to be ordained. But at Vatican news conference to launch the report on Friday, Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri was asked about the suggestion that older married men could become priests. \"The Church is not static ... there is possibility of movement,\" he said. The proposal to allow married men to be ordained priests, called \"viri probati,\" has been floated before at the Vatican. In an interview in March last year, Pope Francis said he was open to studying its possibility. \"We need to consider if 'viri probati' could be a possibility,\" the Pope said in the interview. \"If so, we would need to determine what duties they could undertake, for example, in remote communities.\" Bishop Erwin Krautler, the Secretary of the Commission for the Amazon, told CNN that the bishops will not only discuss the issue of married men, when they meet next year.  \"We don't speak about viri probati, because it's exclusionary. We also want to include women,\" he said. Bishop Fritz Lobinger of South Africa has suggested that a team of elders, men or women, could be nominated and ordained to preside at the Eucharist on Sundays in their own communities as a solution to the crisis. The proposals would not affect the current practice of mandatory celibacy for Catholic priests, which the Pope has said won't change. On the issue of the ordination of women, Francis has appeared to put himself squarely on the side of his predecessors. When asked by a reporter in 2016, Francis cited the declaration of St. John Paul II, adding that \"the final word is clear\" and \"it was said by St. John Paul II and this remains.\" ", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/08/europe/vatican-open-to-role-for-women-in-amazon-intl/index.html", "description": "The Vatican says it is open to discussing the ordination of married men and an official role for women, to address a shortage of priests in the Amazon region.", "title": "Vatican open to role for women and married men in Amazon", "author": "Delia Gallagher and Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN", "date": "2018-06-08 14:14:22"},
{"content": "Ali Bashar, a 20-year-old asylum-seeker, was captured by security forces at the airport in Irbil, northern Iraq, a top senior security official in the Kurdistan Regional Government [KRG] told CNN on Friday. He had fled from Germany to Iraq via Istanbul with his family on June 2.  The arrest was made following close cooperation and coordination with the German consulate in the Kurdistan region, said Dindar Zebari. \"I thank the participating Kurdish security forces for making the arrest possible,\" German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said Friday. Susanna Maria Feldman, a resident in the western German city of Wiesbaden, was reported missing by her mother on May 23.  By the time the police opened an investigation, Bashar and seven other family members --  all of whom lived in a refugee center in Wiesbaden -- had fled using identification papers that German authorities failed to identify as suspect. The plane tickets contained different names from those given on the residence documents for Bashar and his family, officials said. Bashar was first linked with the case after a 13-year-old refugee told police in Wiesbaden on Sunday that the Iraqi man had raped and killed Feldman. The teenager's body was found by police Wednesday close to a railway track in the Erbenheim area of Wiesbaden. Prosecutor Achim Thoma said that strangulation was the cause of death. Bashar arrived in Germany in October 2015 and moved to Wiesbaden with his parents and siblings in April the following year, according to police. Bashar's asylum claim was rejected in December 2017.

{"content": "If you listen to Thiem's coach, Gunter Bresnik, his chances of winning are akin to landing a million dollar jackpot.  \"It's so, so difficult to compete with the guy because he is the best competitor in sport in my opinion, of all time,\" Bresnik told a small group of reporters. \"It doesn't matter what sport. \"He is physically strong and you know he's not going to give up at any score. He's not going to give you a free point if he is up 5-0 or down 5-0.   \"That's why the guy was dominating clay-court tennis the last 14 years like no one else before and nobody ever will.\"  He didn't stop there, such was his extended praise for the recently turned 32-year-old.   READ: Halep, Stephens to play in women's final  READ: Sharapova crashes out  \"To beat Nadal in Paris, on the center court in the finals, I think this is, it's not impossible, but it's maybe one of the biggest (challenges) you can have in tennis.\" Nadal certainly lived up to his \"King of Clay\" nickname in Friday's semifinal against Juan Martin del Potro, crushing the sentimental favorite 6-4 6-1 6-2 to reach a record 11th final at Roland Garros. The world No. 1 became the second man in the Open Era to make 11 finals at the same major, tying friendly rival Roger Federer's mark on the grass of the All England Club.  But while the Swiss has succumbed in three title matches in southwest London, Nadal has never tasted defeat in a final in southwest Paris, as Bresnik -- and the rest of the tennis world -- knows.  Not throwing in towel Yet Bresnik obviously isn't throwing in the towel. And for good reason.  Thiem, who ended the Cinderella stint of Italy's Marco Cecchinato 7-5 7-6 (12-10) 6-1, is one of only three men to topple Nadal at least three times on the \"terre battue.\"  The world No. 8 made history of his own Friday, becoming the second Austrian male to advance to a grand slam final after the hard-nosed 1995 French Open champion, Thomas Muster.  The 24-year-old Thiem was the last player to get the better of Nadal, too, last month at the Madrid Open.  \"I think it helps, definitely, knowing that you were the last guy to beat him,\" said Bresnik, whose association with Thiem spans more than 15 years.  Then again, Thiem upended Nadal in Rome last year before being thumped by the Spaniard in the French Open semifinals weeks later 6-3 6-4 6-0.  \"With Nadal, you need to play at the top level, I would say, minimum, three hours, otherwise don't even think about having a chance to win,\" said Bresnik.  Thiem insists he has a \"plan\" against Nadal, one which he hopes translates to the longer best-of-five set format.  \"He's a big favorite against everybody,\" he told reporters. \"Still, I know how to play against him. I have a plan. I will try everything that my plan is going to work out a little bit here and not only in Madrid or in Rome.\" Nadal acknowledged that Thiem has been a \"very complex\" opponent.  Thiem 'one of the best' on clay \"He's one of the best players in the world on this surface,\" Nadal told reporters.  \"You know when you start the clay court season that Dominic, he's one of these players that have the chance to win every tournament that he's playing, and maybe even more here in Roland Garros because he's strong physically. He has the power.\" Yet so does Nadal.  He appeared to be in near peak form against del Potro -- once the all important first set went in his favor. Nadal had more trouble with another Argentine, the diminutive Diego Schwartzman, in the quarterfinals.  Del Potro's play this tournament, plus his history against Nadal -- the fifth seed won two of their three previous duels and was the last foe to down the Mallorcan in a grand slam semifinal in 2009 -- suggested a close tilt. Or at least not a blowout.  And the first set was indeed tight, even with del Potro calling for the trainer at 2-3. He has undergone four wrist surgeries but the issue, thankfully, was a minor hip complaint.  Del Potro missed six break points in the opener, including three at 4-4. Nadal claimed the final two points of that game in contrasting fashion, ripping a cross-court backhand that left the crowd gasping and deftly hitting a volley off a tricky net cord.  \"I think that was my chance of the match,\" Del Potro said of the ninth game.  Nadal broke in the lone game he had an opportunity to wrap up the set.  When del Potro avoided a bagel in the sixth game of the second, he raised his arms in celebration.  Could only smile And on the penultimate point of the semifinal, after being run ragged, the 2009 US Open winner could only offer up a smile.  At No. 72, Cecchinato was the lowest-ranked men's semifinalist at the French Open since 1999. He impressively recovered from a slow start to make the first set close.  The key moment, though, was the gripping second-set tiebreak.  Thiem led 6-3 but suddenly lost focus. Cecchinato,  who upset Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals after winning two pulsating tiebreaks, rallied and even held three set points prior to Thiem triumphing 12-10.   Cecchinato was understandably deflated -- the third set lasted a mere 24 minutes -- and Thiem officially booked his spot in the final, to his mother's delight.  \"I cannot believe it now,\" Karin Thiem, a tennis coach, told a group of reporters. \"I was so nervous before the match because I knew it would be a tough match. But now I am so happy. I need time I think.\" The smile never left her face.  Looking ahead to the final and recalling Thiem's victory over Nadal in Madrid, a tired del Potro uttered: \"Maybe on Sunday (Thiem) can repeat.\" Visit CNN.com/tennis for more news, features and videos He concluded, however, by saying: \"It's not easy.

Ishiguro, whose family moved to Britain from Japan when he was 5 years old, was honored for services to literature. His best-known novels include \"Never Let Me Go\" and \"The Remains of the Day.\" Thompson starred in the 1993 film adaptation of the latter. Former Liverpool soccer great Kenny Dalglish was also knighted, as was historian and broadcaster Professor Simon Schama. Professor Mary Beard, well known for her work on TV documentaries, was given a damehood for services to the study of classical civilizations. More than 1,000 people received awards in the latest honors list, which is drawn up by the government and approved by the Queen. The list is released twice a year -- at New Year's and for the Queen's official birthday in June. It recognizes the achievements and service of \"extraordinary\" people and includes politicians, academics, journalists, authors and athletes, as well as ordinary citizens who have done outstanding work in their community. A knighthood or damehood is the highest honor awarded. Men are given the title \"Sir,\" while women are given the title \"Dame.\" Below that is a CBE, which stands for Commander of the Order of the British Empire; an OBE, or Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire; followed by an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire. The oldest recipient of an honor in the latest list was 103-year-old Rosemary Powell, who was recognized for her charitable work, having volunteered for the Royal British Legion -- which supports British servicemen and women -- for 97 years. She received an MBE. The youngest, at only 20, was alpine skier Menna Fitzpatrick, Team GB's most decorated Winter Paralympian. The visually impaired teenager, from Wales, thrilled UK fans as she raced down the slopes at the 2018 Winter Paralympics to claim four medals. She and her guide, Jennifer Kehoe, each got an MBE. Another recipient from the sporting arena was world heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua, made an OBE for services to sport. Actor Tom Hardy -- best known for playing Bane in \"Batman: The Dark Knight Rises\" -- was honored with a CBE, as were writer Jeanette Winterson and veteran war correspondent and broadcaster Kate Adie.

It also cemented the 32-year-old Russian's legacy with his first NHL title after 13 seasons in the league. \"It meant everything,\" Ovechkin, a native of Moscow and the team's captain, said. \"I think this moment, we were waiting a long, long time. ... It just was -- joy.\"  \"Was a tough time, but we fight through it and we get the result.,\" he added. \"Now I'm going home to our family, our fans. It's just something special, you know. I'm just very excited and I'm very happy right now.\" The Russian was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2004 NHL draft. What would have been his first season, though, was the 2004-2005 NHL lockout. Then came the years with playoff misery. The Capitals couldn't get out of the second round or past Sidney Crosby's Pittsburgh Penguins, who had eliminated Washington in each of their past seven playoff series and in nine of 10 series overall. \"Every team was special,\" Ovechkin, who has been Washington's captain since 2010, said. \"But I thought the only thing that last couple years, we didn't pass the second round. Just playing, and no satisfaction. Every year we want to fight through it. Finally we did. We knew this year is going to be our year. We just have to believe it and keep working, keep playing.\" This year was different -- and it was thrilling.  Washington trailed in every series in this year's Stanley Cup Playoffs but kept clawing back. The Capitals overcame a pair of home overtime losses to start the postseason in the first round against the Columbus Blue Jackets, before taking out the Penguins in round two. They rallied from a three-game losing streak to defeat the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Eastern Conference Final, including a road win in Game 7. All season long, the big NHL story was the incredible season by the Golden Knights. The expansion team -- the first of any major US sports league to be based in Las Vegas --  was a shock just to make the playoffs in its inaugural season. No one could have predicted reaching the final.  But once the Stanley Cup Final began, the narrative shifted toward Ovechkin and the Capitals, who ended the league's second-longest championship drought by winning its first Stanley Cup in its 44th season. The Los Angeles Kings also captured the 2012 Stanley Cup in its 44th season; the Toronto Maple Leafs haven't won the Cup since 1967. Ovechkin led the playoffs with 15 goals and ranked second in points to teammate Evgeny Kuznetsov, earning him the Conn Smythe Trophy -- the NHL's equivalent to a playoff MVP award. Ovechkin was the second Russian-born winner of the honor since it was first awarded in 1965. Ovechkin is the first Russian captain to win the Stanley Cup and just the third from outside North America, joining Nicklas Lidstrom (Vasteras, Sweden) in 2008 and Zdeno Chara (Trencin, Slovakia) in 2011 with the Bruins.

Lall told Britain's Press Association that he's honored to be taking part in Trooping the Colour for the first time.  \"I hope that people watching, that they will just acknowledge it and that they will look at it as a new change in history,\" Lall told the news agency.  \"I hope that more people like me, not just Sikhs but from other religions and different backgrounds, that they will be encouraged to join the army.\"   Lall, 22, from Leicester, England, joined the British army in 2016.

{"content": "The Romanian rallied from a set and break deficit to beat Sloane Stephens 3-6 6-4 6-1 and win the French Open on Saturday along with her first grand slam title following three near misses.  With chants of \"Si-mo-na, Si-mo-na\" reverberating around Philippe-Chatrier court and Romanian flags in abundance, the majority of fans in attendance in Paris -- including Romania's gymnastic trailblazer Nadia Comaneci -- certainly approved.   They, along with Stephens, knew of the 26-year-old's past heartbreak.    Twelve months ago at Roland Garros, the world No. 1 relinquished a set and 3-0 lead against Jelena Ostapenko in the final. That was the most painful memory.  And then this January, Caroline Wozniacki overturned a break hole at 3-4 in the final set at the Australian Open.  If that wasn't enough, in her other grand slam final in 2014 at the French Open, Halep succumbed in a three-set battle to Maria Sharapova.  That angst, though, will be largely forgotten now. If there were tears for Halep, they were tears of joy.  \"Well, it's an amazing moment,\" she told reporters. \"I was dreaming for this moment since actually I started to play tennis. It's my favorite grand slam. I always said that if I'm going to win one, I want it to be here.\" READ: Nadal, Thiem battle in men's final  READ: Cecchinato stuns Djokovic READ: Lucky loser's long journey  READ: Injured Serena pulls out  The diminutive Halep pummeled a serve on match point. She raised her arms in delight before going into the stands to embrace hugs with her entourage in a now customary scene for grand slam winners.  Halep doubt When Stephens led by a set and 2-0, though, few probably envisaged a comeback, Halep included. \"I said, 'It's not going to happen again, but it's okay. I have just to play,'\" she said. \"And then when I started to win games, I said that last year it happened to me, same thing, I was set and a break up and I lost the match.  \"So I said there is a chance to come back and win it. So I believed in that, and my game was more relaxed. I could make more things on court, and that's why I could win.\" The reversal was all the more impressive considering Stephens had never lost any of her six finals. In her lone prior grand slam final, the 25-year-old eased past friend Madison Keys last September at the US Open.  Her disappointment didn't stop Stephens from expressing happiness for her older peer. Fellow players including twice Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova congratulated Halep, too.  \"I think she's had a tough journey,\" said Stephens. 'I think winning here is very special for her and I'm glad she finally got her first slam. It's a beautiful thing. \"No matter how hard the adversity that you go through, there is always light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm glad she finally got her light,\" added Stephens, who won in New York after undergoing foot surgery.  Halep's influential coach Darren Cahill said all those difficult defeats contributed to Halep's victory Saturday.  \"I think she's grown up a lot in the last 12 months,\" Cahill told a group of reporters. \"Sometimes the losses make you mature pretty quickly. You can go one way with your career and go downwards or you can suck it up, work a little bit harder and try to do it again -- and that's the way she went.\" Halep entered the final as the favorite given her clay-court prowess, higher ranking and holding a 5-2 head-to-head record against her rival.  But in the contest of two of the best movers in tennis, Halep had to work hard for her first hold, prevailing in a 25-shot rally for 1-1. It was an indication of things to come -- in the first set.  Better start for Stephens A composed looking Stephens was indeed the first to break through, gaining a 3-1 advantage.  Stephens regularly threatened the Halep serve, though finally faced a break point at 5-3. To Halep's dismay, she sent a backhand into the net.  A rattled Halep was broken to start the second and Stephens built on the lead by digging out of a 0-30 hole. On the last point of the second game, Stephens scampered and put up a superb lob that prompted a Halep smash error.  The final threatened to be over in quick time.  \"Well, we were very, very worried,\" Virginia Ruzici, Halep's Romanian manager who won the title 40 years ago, told a group of reporters. \"Sloane was playing really well. I think Sloane also got a little bit tired at one point and she started to miss a few. And so Simona could immediately get back into the match.\" Halep reeled off nine straight points to lead 3-2 on serve, then broke for 4-2. Stephens got back to 4-4 but that was the end of her resistance.  Momentum change She was broken to end the set, making a pair of unforced errors down the line on the second and last point of the game as she attempted to alter her patterns facing a now more aggressive opponent.  And a more efficient one. Whereas Halep hit four winners and 10 unforced errors in the first set, she totaled 14 and 16 in the last two.  They weren't bad numbers at all given the surface, occasion and how well Stephens patrols the court.  Both players went off for a toilet break yet it did little to derail Halep, although she did have to get out of a 0-30 hole in the first game.  As Halep scurried to chase a defensive swat that turned into a drop shot for Stephens and won the point for 4-0, Cahill leaped out of his chair and pumped his fist. After coaching Lleyton Hewitt and Andre Agassi, the Australian experienced more grand slam success with Halep.  The job was almost done and it became official when Halep crushed the serve on match point that drew an error.  \"She is a big champion,\" said Ruzici. \"She is huge, she has such qualities. She is the fastest player on the tour and other than that she has all the shots right now.\"  Halep forecast a \"big party tonight\" in Paris. \"I'm waiting for it,\" she said.

{"content": "Meghan, wearing a pale peach off-the-shoulder dress and hat, and Prince Harry, in military uniform, left Buckingham Palace in a horse-drawn carriage for the event, staged on Horse Guards Parade in Whitehall, London. Waiting crowds greeted the couple with cheers as they emerged from the palace. Their appearance comes three weeks after their wedding in Windsor, a ceremony watched by people from around the world. The Queen, dressed in blue, rode by herself in an open carriage. Her husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, turns 97 on Sunday and has retired from public duties. Prince William's wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, traveled with her mother-in-law, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, to Horse Guards Parade.  The monarch is technically the head of Britain's armed forces and would traditionally lead an army into war. The parade gives the Queen a chance to review and approve her army. In earlier years, the Queen would ride sidesaddle on horseback to greet the public. Buckingham Palace tweeted that Elizabeth had attended the Trooping the Colour every year of her reign except for 1955 when the event was canceled because of a general strike.  This year's parade was notable as the first time a member of the Coldstream Guards took part wearing a turban. British Sikh Guardsman Charanpreet Singh Lall, 22, told the Press Association news agency that he hoped people watching would \"look at it as a new change in history.\" \"I hope that more people like me, not just Sikhs but from other religions and different backgrounds, that they will be encouraged to join the army,\" he said. After the parade, the royal family joined the nation's longest-serving monarch on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for a wave to the gathered crowds and an exhilarating flypast by Royal Air Force aircraft, including the famous Red Arrows display team. William and Catherine's older children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, enjoyed the spectacle from the balcony, but the couple's third child, 6-week-old Prince Louis, didn't make an appearance. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex watched the aerial display from a spot on the balcony behind the Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla. The ceremony, one of the most high-profile royal events of the year, culminated with the singing of the national anthem. A 41-gun salute will also be fired in nearby Green Park to mark the occasion.  The Queen makes use of her official birthday, usually celebrated on the second Saturday in June, to award honors to members of the public for their service to the nation.

{"content": "Stunned renovators pulled bundles of decaying, dirt-encrusted banknotes from their clandestine spot under a shop floor in the seaside city of Brighton in May.  The face value of the wartime pot totaled around \u00a330,000 -- the equivalent of about \u00a31.5 million (just over $2 million) today, once the Bank of England's official inflation rates have been factored in.  Sussex police have since taken the moldy \u00a31 and \u00a35 notes for \"safekeeping,\" a spokesperson told CNN. It wasn't immediately clear who owns the premises where the money was found. The site has since become a Cotswold Outdoor clothing retailer, but back between 1936 and 1973, it was a Bradleys Gowns store. Bradleys was a top London furrier and couturier set up in the 1860s. Howard Bradley is now the last remaining heir of the family name and the business, which has continued as a specialist dry cleaners in Milton Keynes, north of London.  He told CNN he was \"shocked\" but \"very excited\" when first contacted by a local reporter and informed of the historic discovery. Bradley said he thought the Brighton store would have been part of his family's company. \"It seems likely. We had a few sub branches (outside London) back in the day,\" he said. He said his father, Eric, was one of the first to sign up to fight in the war -- enlisting for the British Royal Air Force the very day WWII was declared: September 3, 1939. It was also his 18th birthday.  \"He heard (the news) on the radio alone in the kitchen ... and thought, 'Right, I'm going to enlist.' \"  And while Eric was fighting in the deserts of North Africa, his brother Victor enlisted as a pilot.  Family precautions Bradley said he hasn't any ancestral tales alluding to the stashed cash but added that he wouldn't be surprised if someone had hidden some money away during the war.  \"We can trace our British family history back to the 1300s and we had Jewish roots as well,\" Bradley explained. \"Obviously during the Second World War, during the '30s, with what was happening in Germany, they would have been concerned.  \"And the Dunkirk evacuation was going badly, sons were out fighting ... I would imagine they were thinking the worst -- that nobody would come back. I don't blame anyone for taking precautions.\"  He added that during the war the family home in London was struck by a V-1 flying bomb -- or \"doodlebug\" -- and his grandmother had to be \"dug out of the wreckage.\"  With such a close call, Bradley thinks his part-Jewish ancestors may have wanted a rainy-day fund in case they needed to escape Nazi persecution.   \"They would have had to have something to help family and friends, I suspect,\" he added, continuing that the money would likely have funded an escape as \"they would have been on Hitler's kill list.\"  Bradley's father and uncle returned home toward the end of the war in 1944, he said. But it's unclear why no one from the family returned to the store to reclaim the money.  By the 1930s, Bradleys customers were known to have included Churchill and his wife, the British royal family and Hollywood stars such as Brigitte Bardot, according to local Brighton paper, The Argus.   According to the Bank of England, banknotes that have been withdrawn from circulation can be exchanged in person or by mail.

{"content": "He began that quest Sunday, winning his record-extending 11th title on the clay at Roland Garros and 17th major overall with a 6-4 6-3 6-2 victory over his spirited but ultimately vanquished challenger, Dominic Thiem.  \"It's definitely one of the best things somebody ever achieved in sport,\" Thiem told reporters.  Nadal also became the second tennis player ever to win 11 titles at the same major, joining Margaret Court. Court won 11 on home soil at the Australian Open, the last coming near the start of the Open Era in 1973.  The French Open isn't Nadal's home slam but it might as well be.  \"Memories are forever, and I have incredible memories of this event,\" he told reporters. \"I don't want to start explaining all the memories that I have, because they are so long. But since the first time that I came here until today is a love story with this event, not only with the victories, but this is all about the people who are working the event, too.\" Considered to be declining two years ago, Nadal and friendly rival Roger Federer have now won the last six grand slams.    \"We have two of the greatest of all time in one era,\" summed up James Blake, who beat both Nadal and Federer prior to retiring. \"It's fun to see how they match up and how they keep pushing each other.\"  Nadal moved, once again, to within three grand slams of the Swiss. Nadal's uncle and longtime former traveling coach Toni -- who returned to watch his nephew Sunday -- said essentially that only time will tell whether Federer can be caught. He also was aware that Federer might go four clear of Nadal in a month at Wimbledon.    But Nadal himself wasn't too bothered.  \"I never have been crazy about all this kind of stuff,\" he told reporters, and not for the first time when asked about matching the 36-year-old. \"No, you can't be frustrated always if somebody have more money than you, if somebody have a bigger house than you, if somebody have more grand slams than you. You can't live with that feeling, no? You have to do your way. \"And then you have to be happy with the things that are happening to you, no? I happy that other people have things, and I am very satisfied, and I feel very lucky with all the things that happened to me.\" Tennis is lucky to have Nadal. On Friday, Thiem's coach Gunter Bresnik called him the best competitor of all time in any sport. Off the court, Nadal never lacks in humility.  Sunday's score might have looked rather routine but there was some drama in the third set in sticky Paris when Nadal called for the trainer at 2-1, 30-0. It turned out to be for a cramp in a left finger that left him temporarily unable to serve with much pace.  Taking tablets later during a changeover, Nadal didn't seem all that troubled and was able to complete the job on the court he owns, Philippe-Chatrier. Nor did a warning for taking too much time between points bother the left-hander.  When Thiem sent a return long on a fifth match point, Nadal raised his arms in celebration. Holding the trophy during the awards ceremony, he wept.  Despite wracking up one title after another in Paris, it clearly still means plenty to the world No. 1. Nadal said last week that he wanted to keep playing for a while, and if his body co-operates, 15 seems like a realistic possibility.  Strongest challenger Thiem was considered the stiffest test for Nadal at the French Open and understandably so.  The Austrian is one of only three players to down Nadal on clay at least three times; the world No. 8 was the last man to overcome Nadal on clay, last month in Madrid.  But that's the best-of-three sets and in different, faster conditions.  Over the best-of-five sets on clay in 13 years, Nadal improved to 111-2 -- a figure almost as imposing as the nearby Eiffel Tower -- his lone reverses coming against Robin Soderling in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in 2015 at the French Open.  \"If you win a grand slam tournament 11 times, one single one, then this is just very exceptional and amazing,\" said Thiem. \"You need to have, I think, many extraordinary skills and talents and work ethics to achieve that.\" Thiem -- competing in his first grand slam final after a pair of semifinal showings in Paris -- needed to win the first set to have any realistic opportunity of ending Nadal's reign. Why? Nadal was 95-0 when capturing the opener on clay in the best of five format.  Slow starts have plagued Nadal in several of his matches this fortnight, most notably against 11th-seed Diego Schwartzman in the quarterfinals. He lost the first set -- the only one he actually dropped -- then turned things around following a rain delay. He was visited by the trainer that day, too, with Nadal saying it was to prevent sweat from traveling to his hand.  But against Thiem, there was nothing wrong with Nadal's start. He won the first six points and broke for 2-0.  His lead was reminiscent of their semifinal at the French Open last year, when Nadal also held the early advantage.  Thiem's start  Unlike last year -- when those first few games realistically settled matters -- Thiem bounced back, breaking straight away.  The problem for the 24-year-old was that his serve wasn't co-operating. Serving at less than 50% in the first, Nadal got plenty of looks at second serves. Overall the tally was a mere 58%.  Thiem dug in -- especially in the roughly 13-minute sixth game -- but he crumbled attempting to stay in the set, making four unforced errors.  \"In general, it was -- game wise -- a good game. It was just terrible misses,\" said Thiem. Perhaps inexperience.  In a 10-minute second game of the second set, Thiem suffered more trauma. He dropped serve on a fifth break chance.  He however was able to hold serve regularly in the midway stages of the second and even had a chance to get back on serve, but his opening at 2-4 evaporated when Nadal struck a sublime drop shot, then passing shot.  Nadal faced only three break points in the two hour, 42-minute affair.  Thiem now needed to win three straight sets against Nadal on clay -- and the lone person to do that was Djokovic in their 2015 quarterfinal.  He courageously saved three break points to start the third, yet stumbled in his ensuing service game.  Seemingly cruising to victory, that's when Nadal called for the trainer, the second time he did it at the French Open mid-game. On the other, against Paul Henri Mathieu in 2006, a piece of banana got stuck in his throat.   Visit our tennis page for more news, videos and content Nadal is one of the best frontrunners around and indeed there was no choke on the way. He continued to pummel his ground strokes to further inflict woe on Thiem.  \"When someone wins 11 times here, for me it's unbelievable to think about this,\" said uncle Toni.   Thiem, though, knows he isn't the only player to have succumbed to Nadal at the French Open. And the way Nadal is playing on the clay, he won't be the last.

{"content": "He knew in February that the 3-year-old chestnut colt, who had yet to run a race, was something special. After the horse won its first two races, he knew Justify was an amazing raw talent, capable of history. And the horse proved his trainer prescient, winning a Triple Crown with a mesmerizing and dominant victory at the Belmont Stakes on Saturday.  \"It was meant to be,\" Baffert said. Justify defied the difficult post position along the rail, breaking well and taking the lead within seconds. None of the other nine horses had a chance to catch him.  \"I was really happy with way he got away from there,\" jockey Mike Smith said.  The 4-5 favorite handled the 1.5-mile distance easily, and though runner-up Gronkowski was less than 2 lengths back, Justify never looked in danger of losing. \"I wanted to see that horse's name up there (with the other greats) because we know he was brilliant from day one,\" Baffert said. \"And I am so happy for Mike Smith. There is no one more deserving than him.\" Smith said Baffert made his dreams come true. He told reporters he had an easy ride. When he wanted Justify to run fast he would squeeze him, and when he wanted Justify to relax and fall into a rhythm, the jockey would move his hands down. Baffert was a little nervous after the first quarter-mile when Justify went out fast. But the horses slowed down the back stretch and Baffert liked what he saw on the timer at the half-mile pole.  \"I was just watching the clock. It was going to be my friend or the enemy,\" Baffert said when asked about what other horses he was concerned about as the race developed. The trainer said he worried again when Justify made a move forward in the final turn. \"I was like, 'Oh, Mike. Oh, Mike. Don't empty that tank,\" Baffert said. But Justify, like all the great thoroughbreds, found \"another gear,\" Baffert said. Justify won in 2:28.18, well off the record time of 2:24, run by Secretariat in 1973. Baffert also trained Triple Crown winner American Pharoah in 2015. He refused comparisons between the two horses, saying they are different types of racers. Baffert -- who has won more Triple Crown races than anyone -- complimented his team for helping the horse, which ran three major, testing races in five weeks. Justify became the 13th thoroughbred to win horse racing's Triple Crown. He has won all six races he has run this year. Only Seattle Slew in 1977 was also undefeated when he won the Triple Crown. It was the largest Belmont field ever beaten by a Triple Crown winner. Gronkowski, named for the NFL player, finished second, after having been last for the first half of the race. Hofburg was third.

{"content": "It's not that the game itself changed the way football is played, or had a long-lasting effect on the rules and regulations of the sport -- unlike the match between the two nations in the 1966 World Cup, when Antonio Rattin claimed he didn't understand English as the referee indicated he should leave the pitch. Rattin's refusal delayed play for so long that by the next World Cup, in 1970, red and yellow cards had been introduced as universal symbols that required no further explanation. In 1986 what happened in the space of a few minutes was that everything that's possible in a game of football took place on the pitch, in full view of everyone watching, and it was all carried out by one man. The bad and the good, the ugly and the beautiful, lawlessness and perfection all displayed for everyone to see.  Argentine writer Juan Sasturain often says the word 'football' is wrong, because it's not a game one plays with one's feet, it's a game that one is not allowed to play with one's hand. That's almost the main rule.  And yet Argentina's first goal against England was scored with a hand, but unseen by the referee and the linesmen, it was allowed. The infamous \"Hand of God,\" as the perpetrator dubbed it immediately after the match with a certain cheekiness -- rather than blasphemy -- almost like a child blaming his brother for stealing the sweets. \"It must have been the hand of God,\" Maradona chuckled when asked by the media about it. It was a moment that stunned the world. A tiny man outsmarts the tall goalkeeper -- Peter Shilton -- by jumping high in the air with his arm stretched up, closed fist, and simply punches the ball into the net.  As shocking as it was unfair, the tension only rises as the fans inside the stadium and watching on TV wonder if the goal will stand. Some live commentary of the match suggests it will be disallowed -- \"I think he handles the ball\", \"is it hand-ball?\" -- but the authorities on the pitch never call it and goal it is. For the English, a blatant injustice so hard to stomach that bookmakers William Hill paid punters who called it a draw in spite of the final score. READ: 11 moments that shook the World Cup READ: And the winner of the 2018 World Cup will be ... READ: The biggest World Cup upsets And then a few minutes later, the \"Goal of the Century\" -- as it was later voted in a FIFA poll -- the same tiny man receives a pass from his long-time friend, midfielder El Negro Enrique near the halfway line. Maradona starts running and dribbling like a child let loose in the potrero -- the Argentine open spaces where kids runabout with any object that may resemble a ball, lusting for it, hanging on to it, caressing and dancing with it, playing with it, making sure nobody else can take it away -- and as if it was somehow attached to his foot he passes one, two, three ... seven English players. Each one \"left for dead\" as the English commentator said at the time.  Each one with a stunned look in their face, a mixture of horror that this was being done against them and admiration that they had such exclusive access to witness this marvel.  Dutch filmmaker and football writer Joe de Putter once described it as the only miracle of the 20th Century, and he wasn't joking. \"This has nothing to do with the war' Both these goals actually happened and we all saw them. They were real. And they made history. A lot has been said since about them, about their author, and perhaps we have tried too much to extrapolate some further significance or meaning.  Both countries had a long tradition of football rivalry, and to boot it was the first time they met on a sporting arena since the Falklands or Malvinas War four years earlier. Many of the players had, at least on the Argentine side, friends or relatives who had been conscripted, maybe even lost their life. The line \"this has nothing to do with the war\" had been repeated often enough to have instilled the notion that it might have something to do with the hostilities in 1982, and as the national anthems were sang by players on both side some of the Argentines had a warrior-like look on their faces, a hint that this rival is one they particularly wanted to defeat.  \"He toppled his Majesty's troops with no more weapon to hand than a number 10 stitched on his shirt\" is a line from the subsequent hit song Marad\u00f3, by the seminal 1990s Argentine rock band Los Piojos. There's also a significant amount of literature claiming that somehow in Argentina, where it's often said that the only crime is getting caught, people like the first goal better than the second.  And it's true that there is a national narrative that seeks justification, maybe even forgiveness for the first by rationalizing -- perhaps erroneously -- that the victims somehow deserved it.  \"It was like pickpocketing an Englishman,\" Maradona described his feelings in the aftermath. While his friend, musician Fabian Von Quinteiro, once went as far as saying: \"The sinking of the Belgrano was also a hand goal,\" in reference to the Argentine Navy cruiser controversially sunk by a British submarine outside the exclusion zone during the 1982 conflict. Jorge Valdano, who played alongside and tried to keep up with Maradona hoping to receive the ball in the unlikely event that it should be passed, later said: \"In the potrero the second goal is worth two,\" as if the informal rules of the street kickabout should take priority over the formal rules of the World Cup. Jorge Burruchaga, when asked if he saw the handball at the time of the first goal, told CNN Sport: \"No. I was on the opposite side, 20-25 meters away so I didn't notice. I realized [something was up] because they all had surprised faces, and we celebrated in surprise. \"But also after that came a goal which, for me, is still the best in World Cup history. A goal which was worth the one with the hand and two more.\"  It's as if the two goals are rolled into one, and Argentina as a whole cannot think of of one without the other.  Ask any Argentine about the \"Hand,\" and they will mention the \"Dribble\" in the same breath.  READ: How Australia kept fit on 250,000 km World Cup journey READ: Your Country Needs You! What nationality means to the modern-day footballer Phoenix-like reinvention And what of the genius who gave us those minutes of extreme emotions that day on a Mexican football pitch.  Quite simply the best football player who ever lived? Or was he? Permanently compared to other greats; was he better than Pele, than Johan Cruyff? He arrived on the heels of Argentina's greatest, Alfredo Di Stefano, and left the position for the current world supremo, Lionel Messi. Maradona is so adored that when his off-the-field misdemeanours, not to say crimes, often left him at death's door, mass vigils popped up round the world, from Bangladesh to Naples.  A church has been started in his name. There is a museum devoted to him in Buenos Aires, located in the house where he grew up as a teenager. Grown men cry when they are able to evoke the emotions he has managed to awaken with his undisputed talent.  Though interestingly when opinion polls are run to chose Argentina's best sports personality in history, for instance, the mild-mannered good-natured Juan Manuel Fangio wins hands down every time.   In the 32 years since those two goals which we have come to think of as a single event, the rollercoaster nature of his life has seen him hit the headlines over and over: he has risen to deity status and fallen from grace to the darkest pits imaginable only to rise back up. Which defining World Cup moment stands out for you? Have your say on our Facebook page or by tweeting @CNNSport From one of the world's biggest doping scandals on a World Cup forum, to a phoenix-like reinvention as the most charming manager ever to grace the game, his personal issues with addiction, substance abuse, illegitimate children, and feuds over money pale in comparison to his huge personality -- his charisma spreads wherever he is. If he hosts a TV show, it's the most amazing and surreal TV show anybody has ever seen. If he enters a room, people stand in ceremony and tell the tale for years after of how they were in the room when he entered it.  Power. Charm. Talent.  And the ability to be seen to be frail, vulnerable and imperfect with it.  A walking contradiction that somehow validates contradiction; gives us all permission to accept our own humanity, our faults, our undesirable desires.  Whether or not he was better than Pele or Cruyff is neither here nor there. He is truly unique, and the literal proof of this can be seen in those two goals he scored against England in 1986.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/11/football/world-cup-argentina-england-1986-diego-maradona/index.html", "description": "It could be argued that the history of the World Cup can be defined as before and after the game between England and Argentina 32 years ago -- with one Diego Armando Maradona as protagonist.", "title": "Diego Maradona: How the 'Hand of God' and the 'Goal of the Century' redefined football", "author": "Marcela Mora y Araujo, for CNN\nVideo by Patrick Sung, CNN", "date": "2018-06-11 07:45:36"},
{"content": "South Africa, who went into the tournament seven points adrift of Fiji, faced England in the last match of the season knowing a win would see them take the spoils.  In a rain-soaked Stade Jean-Bouin on Sunday, the Blitzboks duly delivered -- winning the Cup Final 24-14 and successfully defending their championship crown. It was a cruel blow for Fiji, who suffered a shock defeat to England in the quarterfinals and had to watch on in Paris as their Series lead slipped away, despite having won five of the previous six tournaments.  Tries from Werner Kok, Ryan Oosthuizen and Dewald Human saw the Blitzboks come from behind and achieve a remarkable double -- something the players could only have dreamed of at the start of the weekend. \"At the beginning of the tournament we said that we're not going to focus on the results, we want to go out and play some fantastic rugby and it's out of our hands -- we can only control the controllable,\" said South Africa captain Phil Snyman. \"I still can't believe we managed to crawl [it] back, but all honor to God and all honor to the team, I think they played phenomenal rugby.\" READ: When rugby stars are 'too nervous' to play 'The ball went our way' The conclusion to the season was full of twists and turns as South Africa's fairytale ending was almost dashed on a number of occasions.  Neil Powell's men lost their opening game to Scotland and would have seen their title bid ended were it not for a missed conversion by Spain in the final play of the quarterfinal clash.  But fate was to be on the side of the South Africans.  \"Anything can happen in Sevens,\" Snyman told CNN.  \"If Spain had kicked that conversion, then we would have been out of it. You have to fight all the way and never give up. Luckily today the ball went our way.\" South Africa hadn't won a tournament since the first outing of the season in Dubai. In the eight tournaments between then and Paris, they secured three bronze and three silver medal finishes, a consistency that's helped them stay in contention throughout the season. Fiji, however, will rue their slow start in the opening three tournaments as they ended just two points shy of their rivals. READ: The Fiji captain raised in a one-room home 'Bittersweet' end for Australia At the end of the women's competition, there were mixed feelings for Australia who, despite having the series wrapped up ahead of Sunday's Final, went on to lose that game 33-7 to rivals New Zealand.  The overwhelming feeling, however, will be one of relief, as twice in Paris they had to come back from behind in order to secure their Series win -- first against Fiji, and then again against France where a late, length-of-the-field try sent them into Sunday's showpiece.  \"I guess it's a bit bittersweet when you don't come away with the win in that last one,\" Charlotte Caslick, who was crowned DHL Impact Player of the Year in Paris, told CNN. \"I'm really proud of the girls.

Australia have gone toe-to-toe with New Zealand throughout the season, and now have two World Series titles to the Black Ferns' four.

Upsets take different shapes Switzerland's 1-0 win in 2010 over eventual tournament winners Spain takes second place in the Gracenote rankings. The Swiss had just a 10.3% chance of winning the match over the tournament favorites and escaped despite shooting just 6 shots on goal to Spain's 22.  But the loss probably served to wake up Andres Iniesta, David Villa and co. enough to go on a winning run.  Algeria's 2-1 win over a West German team led by Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in 1982 is ranked the third-greatest upset of all time.  Any Algerian old enough will remember where he or she was when the North Africans stunned one of Europe's powerhouses.  Led by an assist and winning goal from Lakhdar Belloumi, Algeria pulled off the inconceivable in its first-ever World Cup match. West Germany eventually lost to tournament winners Italy in the 1982 final.   In fourth place is Ghana's win over the Czech Republic in 2006 with the Black Stars given just a 13.9% chance of beating a team led by Pavel Nedv\u011bd. Making their World Cup debut, the Ghanians had already lost to Italy entering the match in Cologne, Germany. But a goal just 70 seconds in from Asamoah Gyan set the tone and Ghana won 2-0.  Another match at the 1950 World Cup provided another major upset -- this time in the final.  With hosts Brazil leading 1-0 and seemingly cruising to victory in front of a crowd of 200,000 in Rio De Janeiro's Maracana stadium, Uruguay scored twice in 13 minutes to claim the tournament and stun the hosts.  Uruguay were given just a 14.3% chance of winning the 1950 World Cup decider -- not that much lower than Germany's 22% chance of beating Brazil in the 2014 World Cup seminfinals.

What nationality means to the modern-day footballer Brazil's road to redemption  Brazil's 2014 World Cup was billed as a redemption of sorts, to do away with the bitter feelings from Uruguay's shock win 64 years earlier.  Instead, an injury to star striker Neymar and a suspension of stalwart defender Thiago Silva, contributed to a 7-1 thumping at the hands of the eventual victors.  Brazil's loss to Italy in 1982 was equally devastating -- but at least that happened thousands of miles away in Spain.  Led by the likes of Zico, Socrates, Falcao, Junior and Eder, Brazil's '82 World Cup squad was probably the the most hyped World Cup team to ever lose a tournament. Going into its second-round battle, Italy had less than a 19% chance of winning the match. But the Azzurri picked the right time to pull of what is still its biggest World Cup upset -- putting together a perfect match behind a Paulo Rossi hattrick.  Italy went on to win the tournament, while the Brazilians redeemed themselves by winning the 1994 and 2002 Word Cups. Which defining World Cup moment stands out for you? Have your say on our Facebook page or by tweeting @CNNSport Could redemption be in the cards again for the Brazilians after its 2014 meltdown?  Gracenote has yet another statistic of note: There is a 35% chance that Brazil and Germany could meet again in Russia, with the two countries forming the second-most likely final matchup. First, however, Brazil will have to escape potential major upsets in its group stage at the hands of Serbia (10.7% chance of winning) and Costa Rica (11.4%).

{"content": "Until just a few days ago, it looked like members of Parliament would overturn key parts of May's Brexit plans -- and in turn wield the power to bring down her government. Yet now, with just hours to go before the parliamentary showdown, the Prime Minister looks as though she has brought her administration back from the brink. Exactly a year ago, it looked like May did not have long left in office. She had almost lost a general election she never needed to call, squandering her Conservative Party's overall majority and forcing her to rely on the support of the smaller Democratic Unionist Party. Within days of this electoral calamity, May was heavily criticized for her response to a genuine disaster -- the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower that claimed 71 lives. A party divided In the months that followed, May struggled to assert her authority over her party and government, with a string of ministers resigning from the Cabinet and disunity over Brexit among those who remained around her top table. The Prime Minister was forced to mollify different parts of her party -- including those arch Brexiteers who would rather the UK crashed out of the EU with no deal than the government agree to a soft Brexit, as well as rebellious Conservative MPs who want the public to have another vote on what Brexit will look like.  Pressure intensified when, in a series of votes in the House of Lords last month, peers changed key aspects of May's Brexit plans, even voting to keep Britain in the single market and customs union. It is these 15 changes that MPs will vote on this week -- either keeping the Lords amendments, which would endanger May's government, or overturning them in favor of the Prime Minister. By last week, Cabinet ministers were openly undermining May's authority, setting up what had the potential to be May's final scene as Prime Minister, with defeat this week in the Commons on the Brexit bill. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told a private dinner, in comments that were recorded and leaked to Buzzfeed, that Donald Trump would make a better negotiator with Brussels on Brexit. May's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, seemed to be on the verge of resigning over the government's plans for a backstop to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Yet over the course of a few days, the Prime Minister has, apparently, turned things around. Davis has suggested he will resign several times since entering the job two years ago, and each time he failed to do so has strengthened May's position. She agreed to demands from Davis and fellow Brexiteers to put a time limit on the backstop customs proposal, yet left the door open to it being extended.  Crucially, over the weekend, two senior MPs and former ministers from either side of the Brexit divide in the Conservative Party joined forces to urge their fellow MPs to back the government in the Commons votes on Tuesday and Wednesday. Amber Rudd, the ex-Home Secretary and a leading supporter of Britain remaining in the EU, and Iain Duncan Smith, a prominent campaigner for Leave, co-wrote an article urging unity among Conservatives. There are suggestions that some of the Tory MPs who had been poised to rebel have changed their minds, for fear of letting the opposition Labour Party and leader Jeremy Corbyn seize power. For Labour's part, in fact, the leadership's plans in this week's votes weaken the chances of government defeat, because their MPs are being urged to back different amendments to the Brexit legislation, rather than support the changes made in the House of Lords. May seems safe -- for now It seems that May will survive as Prime Minister -- for now at least. On Monday night, she will address her MPs at a private meeting, urging them to \"send a message to the country\" that the Conservative Party is united on Britain's withdrawal from the EU.  A year after that election, it is, perhaps, her sheer longevity in office, the simple fact that she has clung on to power despite all the challenges, that has made her stronger. Yet how long will this unity last? At some point, there will have to be a reckoning on Brexit. Lingering concerns over the way the Brexit referendum was won were fueled over the weekend when it emerged that Arron Banks, a major donor to the Leave campaign, had previously undisclosed meetings with senior Russian officials in the run-up to the June 2016 vote. (Banks says he's the victim of a witch-hunt.)  While these revelations don't immediately affect the British Prime Minister, they are likely to stiffen the resolve of the die-hard Remain supporters -- including some Conservative MPs -- who want the Brexit plans to be put to another referendum. The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland has not been solved. And while May has managed to assert some authority inside her government and party, she remains weak in Brussels. And the negotiation process demands that Britain has made significant progress on the key issues of Brexit before an EU summit at the end of this month -- including on the contentious issue of a customs union, to which Brexiteers remain steadfastly opposed.  There are also more votes to come in the Commons later this month, on separate Brexit legislation, that could see disgruntled Conservative MPs stage a rebellion. The Prime Minister seems to have averted disaster for her government this week -- but maybe only this week.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/11/uk/theresa-may-brexit-vote-intl/index.html", "description": "This week, British Prime Minister Theresa May faces a moment of truth over Brexit.", "title": "Theresa May's day of Brexit reckoning is coming, sooner or later", "author": "Analysis by Jane Merrick, for CNN", "date": "2018-06-11 10:42:02"},

{"content": "The Aquarius, which is carrying more than 600 migrants who were pulled out of the sea by rescuers over the weekend, was left stranded in the Mediterranean after Matteo Salvini, Italy's hardline interior minister and leader of the anti-immigration League party, refused to allow it to dock on Sunday. More than 120 unaccompanied minors and seven pregnant women are on board the ship. By Monday, supplies were beginning to run low and a number of people were in need of medical treatment, including 15 with serious chemical burns and several others suffering from hypothermia, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which operates the rescue ship Aquarius alongside SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. MSF Spain said that while it appreciated the gesture from the Spanish government, it would be unsafe for the boat, which was over capacity and carrying people who needed medical attention, to make the three day trip to Valencia.  The boat has not received formal instructions from Italy or Spain to set sail to Valencia, a roughly 800-mile journey. \"We are staying put until we are told where to go. We have no food or water to make it to Spain anyway,\" an MSF spokesperson said. The Maltese government, which had also refused to let the Aquarius dock, delivered noodles, biscuits and bottles of drinking water to replenish the boat.  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced Monday afternoon that the ship and its passengers would be welcome in Valencia, in an effort to prevent a humanitarian disaster from unfolding. \"It is our obligation to help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer 'a safe harbor' to these people, thus complying with obligations of international law,\" he said in a statement.    The news was met with glee by Salvini, who took to social media within minutes to celebrate. \"VICTORY! 629 migrants on board of Aquarius ship, Spain-bound, our first goal has been reached!\" he wrote on Facebook. Salvini had called on Italy to \"close the ports\" and pledged Sunday to \"STOP the filthy business of illegal immigration.\" Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also welcomed Spain's announcement, describing it as an \"important turning point\" in a Facebook post and adding that \"Italy's requests begin to be heard.\" The move comes as the number of migrants arriving on Spanish shores continues to grow. Migrant arrivals to Spain have increased by 50% so far in 2018 compared to last year, while Italy has seen around a 75% decline, according to the International Organization for Migrants (IOM). In the first week of June alone, 561 migrants arrived in Spain by sea. Asked about the Italian move, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said at a briefing on Monday that he is concerned that the \"space for refugee protection in Europe might be shrinking.\" \"My strong appeal is that, recognizing that countries have the right to manage their borders and have the right to define their own migration policies, countries should do it in a protection sensitive way and countries should do it in full respect for international refugee law.\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein praised Sanchez, saying that his decision to accept the ship was \"courageous and welcome.\" The European Union and the UN refugee agency had called earlier for a quick resolution to the situation.  Anxiety grows aboard the Aquarius From Saturday night into Sunday morning, the Aquarius took on 629 people in six separate operations, MSF and SOS said on Twitter. The boat has been stranded between Malta and the Italian island of Sicily since Sunday, when the Italian Coast Guard told Aquarius to hold its current position, according to MSF. Speaking to Spanish public radio broadcaster RNE Monday morning, Aloys Vimard, project coordinator on the Aquarius, said that on-board food supplies would last only one more day.  Nicola Stalla, search-and-rescue coordinator on the ship, told CNN that the scenario was unprecedented.  \"We have never been in a situation before where we have been denied a right to a port of safety,\" he said Monday via a WhatsApp message. \"We are nonetheless prepared to take care of the rescued people until we are.\"  Anxiety was growing among the passengers on Monday afternoon, who were asking when they will reach shore, according to Anelise Borges, a Euronews and NBC journalist currently on board Aquarius. \"There's a certain tension in the air,\" she told CNN. \"Everyone is extremely hot and very tired.\" Many were also worried that they could be returned to Libya. \"The fear is so present, so palpable,\" Borges said.  In footage posted to Twitter by Borges, women were sitting and lying on the floor in an enclosed area below deck, one fanning another to combat the heat.  There are no showers or sinks for migrants on the Aquarius, and rescue workers use a disinfectant spray on people's hands before they eat. Drinking water supplies are unlimited as the ship has its own water purification system, but the passengers were surviving mostly on energy biscuits, prepackaged warm rice, tea and bread.  Women and children sleep below deck, watched over by a midwife, while the men sleep on the open deck, covered only with tarpaulin. More rescue ships on the way Tensions in the Mediterranean are likely to rise as more rescue ships head for the Italian coast. According to Flavio di Giacomo, spokesman for the IOM, an additional 790 migrants were rescued Sunday by the Italian Coast Guard. \"I don't think the Italian government can deny a port of safety to the Italian Coast Guard, but they can to a foreign-flagged ship like the Aquarius,\" he told CNN on Monday. The Aquarius flies the flag of Gibraltar. An Italian Coast Guard boat carrying over 900 migrants will dock in Catania on Tuesday, guard spokesman Cosimo Nicastro told CNN. They were rescued by the guard and the Italian Navy off the coast of Libya, he said. The boat is carrying 937 rescued migrants and two people who died, Nicastro said. Salvini also signaled his intention Monday to prevent a second foreign-flagged search-and-rescue vessel, Sea Watch 3, operated by a group of German volunteers and currently positioned off the coast of Libya, from docking.  Speaking to reporters later in the day, Salvini said that the government \"will have the same attitude towards other NGO ships\" as towards Aquarius. During the recent federal election campaign that led to Italy's new government -- a coalition between the anti-immigrant League and anti-establishment Five Star Movement -- Salvini promoted his party with an \"Italians first\" slogan and pledged to deport half a million migrants. In August 2016, he called for \"mass ethnic cleansing\" in Italy, \"street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood, with strong manners if we need to,\" according to Italian news agency ANSA. Salvini's rhetoric has softened slightly since he took office, but on a visit to Sicily last week, he declared that Italy \"cannot be Europe's refugee camp.\" 'A minister without heart' On Sunday, several Italian mayors defied Salvini and suggested they would be prepared to welcome the Aquarius into their port.  Leoluca Orlando, mayor of the Sicilian capital Palermo, said Sunday that his city \"will always be ready to welcome ships, civilian or military, which are committed to rescuing lives in the Mediterranean,\" and accused Salvini of violating international law.  The mayors of Naples and Reggio Calabria -- two coastal cities in mainland Italy -- also said they would allow the ship to dock. There are also signs of dissent within the coalition. Filippo Nograin, the Five Star mayor of Livorno, a port town in Tuscany, said on Facebook that he would welcome the migrants. He later deleted the post, telling the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that he didn't want to \"create problems\" in the government.  Such offers are largely symbolic, as only the Maritime Rescue Coordination Center, an arm of the Italian Coast Guard, can authorize the docking of a foreign-flagged ship. However, such strong and public rejection of the government's immigration policy could put pressure on Prime Minister Conte and his coalition just a week into its term.   The Mediterranean remains the world's deadliest migration route, despite sharp falls in the number of people trying to reach Europe by boat. That drop is partly ascribed to a deal struck between Italy and Libya last year, in which the southern European country pledged to bolster Libya's coast guard so it could spot departing migrant boats and house migrants attempting to cross. As of June 6, there had been an estimated 785 deaths on the route this year, the IOM said, with the majority of the 33,400 migrants and refugees arriving through Greece and Italy.

With 175,000 participants, according to Gure Esku Dago, the group almost doubled the 100,000 it said it would need to link the chain.  \"The need to decide here in the Basque Country is what has brought together more than 175,000 people today. We are not afraid of freedom. The future is in our hands. Gure Esku Dago! #BasquesDecide,\" Gure Esku Dago wrote in a Facebook post.  The chain wasn't strictly about the right to vote for independence. It was also about the right of governance, and importantly, the right of Basques to control their pensions. Organizers drafted a document including 2019 reasons defending their right to decide the independence of the Basque Country. The document was handed to the Basque Parliament in Vitoria. The Spanish constitution, which was ratified in 1978 after the regime of dictator Francisco Franco, states that Spain is both \"common and indivisible\" and maintains that any independence ballot is illegal. The harsh legal crackdown last year in Catalonia underlined the broad authority Madrid has to stamp out any full-fledged independence movement in order to keep Spain intact. The Basque Country is already one of the most autonomous regions in Spain, having its own police force, education system, language and fiscal agreements, according to Reuters. According to the Euskobarometer, a survey conducted by the University of the Basque Country that measures different levels of sentiment, 23% of Basques felt like they were more Basque than Spanish, and 35% felt they were entirely Basque. However, only 23% of Basques would vote for independence while 43% would vote against it, according to a separate study carried out by the Bilbao-based University of Deusto. Nonetheless, many Basques -- almost 40% -- would like to have even more autonomy and believe they should have the right to vote for independence, according to the study.  The human chain comes a few months after ETA -- the Basque separatist group that killed around 850 people in its half-century campaign for independence -- formally disbanded in April. The group sent a letter to various governmental institutions and media agencies in which it apologized to the families of the victims and accepted \"direct responsibility\" for its crimes. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who recently became Spain's new Prime Minister after replacing Mariano Rajoy after a no-confidence vote, in the past has called for more autonomy for the Basque Country. Rajoy was criticized for his harsh response to the independence vote in Catalonia, which included the use of Spanish national police to suppress voting and the dissolution of the Catalan parliament.  The Basque Nationalist Party initially supported Rajoy, but then ultimately voted for the no confidence motion, which ousted Rajoy from office, making way for S\u00e1nchez to become prime minister.

Previously they had to have served in Helmand in 2012, and for at least a year. The government estimates the number of visas issued under the program would rise to 200.  Writing for the Daily Mail, Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson praised interpreters as the \"unsung heroes\" who served with \"dazzling distinction\" following the 2001 US-led military invasion. \"Standing shoulder to shoulder with our troops on the battlefield, they demonstrated unflinching courage in carrying out duties that were fraught with great difficulty and danger. \"I cannot be clearer in expressing our nation's eternal appreciation to these brave individuals who regularly risked life and limb to help defeat our enemies and protect us from terrorists,\" he wrote.  'The Taliban would kill him' The move comes at a time where the British government has faced severe criticism for its treatment of immigrants and Afghan interpreters.

Campaigners believe the proposed changes could help some interpreters who served, but would still leave a large number who are being removed at risk.  \"If Bari is sent back to Afghanistan the Taliban would kill him -- it's a breach of his human rights,\" President of Glasgow Afghans United Abdul Bostani told CNN.  \"All they would be concerned with is that he was an interpreter for the West and therefore they would see him as a spy. \"Interpreters who have worked for the army have done so in good faith and it's a failure from the Home Office to not consider their application for asylum.

Motivated by that failure, and after being introduced by a mutual friend, four-time Olympic champion Ainslie went for a beer with Jim Ratcliffe -- who is the head of petrochemical company Ineos and was last month revealed as Britain's richest man with an estimated wealth of $28 billion. A $153m deal happened at lightning speed. Ainslie, who will lead a newly-branded Ineos Team UK team, told CNN: \"I realized he'd been successful in business but, at the time of meeting, I wasn't quite aware he was Britain's richest man at that point! \"But I'd read about his exploits as an adventurer going to both Poles and taking part in crazy full-on marathons across deserts. I knew he had an interest in sailing so we got together for a chat and that got to talking about the America's Cup. \"Jim got back to me the next day, was really excited about the challenge and wanted to get involved.\" And discussions quickly translated to actions. As Ainslie put it, \"Ineos has ventures all over the world so, when an opportunity like that comes up, you have to grab it quickly.\" 'It's all about winning' Ineos, one Britain's largest privately owned company and one of the world's top 10 petrochemicals firms, was founded by Ratcliffe 20 years ago.

But he doesn't apologize for making the change he believes is required for Britain to have any hope of winning the Auld Mug for the first time since the event's inception on British waters in 1851. \"With the challenges we were facing, we were talking about bigger budgets for a winning strategy,\" he said.  \"Those guys [the past backers] understand that and, at the end of the day, they understand the need to go down this route as from the outset the goal has always been the same... to win the America's Cup. They've been very good about it.\" Ainslie knows teaming up with Ineos gives Britain its best chance of winning the Cup when it takes place in New Zealand, which beat Land Rover BAR in the semifinals on its way to victory in the 2017 competition.  \"I'm not going to say we're going to win the Cup but now we have all the elements in place,\" said Britain's most celebrated sailor who, in addition to his Olympic success, boasts an America's Cup win with Team Oracle USA in 2013. \"Now it's down to us to make the right decisions.\" Each  The rise in costs is down to new rules laid out by Emirates Team New Zealand.

Other appointments are set to be made in the coming months across both the design team and the sailing crew. \"The event last summer was by far and away was my lowest experience in sport as we never had a look-in going into the competition,\" admits Ainslie. \"We knew from the start that we were unlikely to make it through and be competitive. That's what made it so tough. Everyone was just gutted.\" 'A dollop of luck' Ainslie has been impressed with how the entire team has reacted to that low. So how does he assess the team's chances of Cup glory three years out? \"We're in a great position but we know how difficult it is to win this,\" he said. \"You need the right backers, the right people and the right strategy. Then, you can't afford to make any mistakes plus you need a sizable dollop of luck as well.\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/12/sport/jim-ratcliffe-ineos-ben-ainslie-americas-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "description": "A drink with Britain's richest man has given Ben Ainslie Britain's best chance of a first America's Cup win since its inception in 1851.", "title": "America's Cup: How a beer led to a $153 million investment to break GB duck", "author": "Matt Majendie, for CNN", "date": "2018-06-12 13:21:00"},
{"content": "The three-year-old chestnut colt became the 13th horse ever to win the Triple Crown of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes after a dominant victory at Belmont Park in New York Saturday. Forbes has estimated that once retired, Justify could demand an initial $100,000 stud fee -- giving him a $60 million value based solely on breeding fees if he were to cover 150 mares per breeding season for four years.  Depending on the racing performances of his offspring, this value could rise even higher.  In England, Godolphin stallion Dubawi's stud fees have risen from \u00a325,000 ($34,000) to \u00a3250,000 ($334,000) after becoming the fastest ever to sire to 50 Group race winners.

Justify has won all six races he has run this year -- Seattle Slew was the only other undefeated horse to win the Triple Crown in 1977. It's an impressive feat for a horse that only started racing 113 days ago and was originally purchased for $500,000. READ: Justify wins Triple Crown with dominant victory at Belmont Justify's hall-of-fame trainer Bob Baffert said the win was meant to be. \"I wanted to see that horse's name up there (with the other greats) because we know he was brilliant from day one,\" he told reporters. Baffert has trained more winners in Triple Crown races (15) than anyone -- he also trained 2015 Triple Crown champion American Pharoah. Following the Belmont Stakes race, some began to accuse another one of Baffert's horses, Restoring Hope, as assisting Justify and jockey Mike Smith by blocking other horses in the race.  However, Smith was quick to dispute those claims. \"I don't see how (Restoring Hope) got in anyone's way,\" the jockey told CNN Sport's Don Riddell. \"I went back to look at (the footage) after I read that, I've checked it several times.

Following on from the International Football Association Board's decision to approve hand-held technologies on the bench, world governing body FIFA is allowing all 32 teams at the tournament to receive real-time support from an analyst throughout the duration of games. \"The software and infrastructure FIFA has put in place for the 2018 World Cup allows all teams a stable and secure connection between the match analysts located in the stands to the technical staff on the bench pitch side,\" a FIFA spokesperson told CNN in a statement.  \"By providing this dedicated platform, each team that chooses to use the system will have exactly the same capacity to provide visual and statistical data that can inform in-game decision making throughout the tournament.\" Sitting in the media section of stadiums, analysts will be able to  track players' movements from two optical cameras and send coaches annotated video clips on the team's performance. This information would then be sent to coaching staff through a tablet device, allowing the two to communicate with each other. At the 2014 World Cup, information from analysts was only provided to coaching staff during halftime or after the game.

Should he go that route, James could sign with a team in early July. \"I have no idea at this point,\" James said after the NBA Finals when asked if he's played his last game for the Cavaliers after getting swept by the Golden Warriors. \"The one thing that I've always done is considered, obviously, my family.

In 2014, he made massive headlines again by returning to Cleveland -- and fulfilling his promise to bring a championship to the city in 2016. So where will James play next season? These are some of the most talked about teams seen as potential contenders to land The King. Cleveland Cavaliers The Cavaliers can offer James the biggest deal: 5 years and more than $200 million. Other teams can only offer 4-year deals worth around $150 million. Cleveland also has the No. 8 pick in the NBA draft. Having grown up in nearby Akron, Ohio is James' home. But as getting swept in the NBA Finals showed, the current makeup of Cleveland's roster likely isn't good enough to win an NBA championship. It also could struggle to get out of the Eastern Conference with younger teams like Boston and Philadelphia on the rise. READ: LeBron James: Keeping a billion-dollar body in shape Another downside in coming back: The NBA has a salary cap system, and Cleveland is over the limit, meaning it would need to pay a hefty luxury tax penalty. At the moment, James staying feels unrealistic. Philadelphia 76ers This is an interesting possibility. The 76ers have excellent young talent in 24-year-old Joel Embiid, 21-year-old Ben Simmons and 24-year-old Dario Saric. Brett Brown is a well respected coach. The 76ers also are well under the cap and are one of the best teams positioned to spend in free agency.

He has two homes there. READ: The evolution of the NBA title ringThere's also the money. According to Spotrac, the Lakers have the most cap space. But they need more than James to come to Los Angeles to be a playoff contender. Would California native Paul George join him? Might Chris Paul take less money and head to Los Angeles? If James ends up with the Lakers, he'll need to bring help with him. Houston Rockets This feels like a long shot. Houston doesn't have the money to offer to James. That likely would be needed to re-sign Paul and/or Clint Capela. Still, Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has admitted openly he is obsessed about beating the Golden State Warriors, and his team came oh-so-close this year, falling in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. Morey isn't shy about making moves, like when he acquired Paul in a blockbuster trade last summer. Can he shed Ryan Anderson's contract? Would Paul sign for less?

Arnault's lawyer Bjorn Hurtig told CNN affiliate Expressen that his client denies the charges. \"He is both disturbed and resigned,\" Hurtig said. \"He says this is totally wrong and he is completely innocent of the allegations.\" On May 4, the Swedish Academy, responsible for awarding the prize since its inception more than a century ago, announced that this year's award would be postponed for the first time in 75 years following a crisis within the academy over the handling of allegations against Arnault. Arnault, a leading cultural figure in Sweden, is facing multiple allegations of sexual assault and harassment, first reported in the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter late last year. A total of 18 women spoke to the newspaper accusing Arnault of a range of sexual misconduct between 1996 and 2017.  It is also alleged that he touched Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria inappropriately at a Swedish Academy event in 2006. CNN has not independently verified any of the claims and Arnault denies all allegations, Hurtig told CNN last month. The academy is also under fire for contravening its own conflict of interest regulations by providing funding to the cultural forum run by Arnault and his wife Katarina Frostenson, an academy member until two months ago. In the wake of the revelations -- and an investigation that found there had been \"unacceptable behavior by (Arnault) in the form of unwanted intimacy\" -- six members of the Swedish Academy stepped down, including Frostenson and its head Sara Danius, leaving just 10 active members.  Explaining the academy's decision to postpone this year's Nobel Prize, Anders Olsson, the academy's acting permanent secretary said, \"We find it necessary to commit time to recovering public confidence in the academy before the next laureate can be announced.\" In a statement, he said the academy was acting \"out of respect for previous and future literature laureates, the Nobel Foundation and the general public.\" The decision does not affect the other Nobel prizes, which are awarded separately.

Former defender Christian Ziege, a World Cup runner-up in 2002, puts Germany's success down to the domestic game's reliance on youth. \"I played myself with the Germany youth team against England in the past and I think they have so many good players,\"  says Ziege, who has since gone on to coach the likes of Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, Matthias Ginter and Timo Werner while working with Germany's Under-18 and U19 teams.  \"The only problem is they're not going to play in the Premier League because the top clubs are more or less only using players with experience that cost a lot of money.  \"The good thing is when you can't spend too much money, you can put young players into the teams. They get that experience; they can play.  \"We sent a team for the Confederations Cup without nearly all the main players and ended up winning that trophy as well.\" The squad that Ziege speaks of boasted an average age of just 24 -- the youngest at the tournament -- but rallied to win the World Cup warmup in style.  Instilling a winning mentality at an early age can only be beneficial, according to Matth\u00e4us, who led Germany to glory at Italia 1990. \"From these academies, the national team profits,\" says the former defensive midfielder, who remains the only player to appear in five different World Cups. \"They are ready when they get the invitation. When they get the chance to play, they will show the quality of men.\" READ: Maradona and 'the only miracle of the 20th century' Mentality  Rival fans talk enviously of the so-called \"German mentality,\" using the phrase as shorthand for ruthless efficiency in the will to win.  \"You can see it not only in football, but in the cars,\" jokes Matth\u00e4us. \"We have the best cars around the world -- with BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, blah blah blah! We like to always do the best, and for this you have to work very hard.  \"We are never satisfied. We always do the next step. And I think this is the German mentality.\" But for Ziege, who amassed 72 caps between 1993 and 2004, \"something has changed a little bit ... and that's the reason we have so much talent now in our football.\"  The new generation is cut from a different cloth, the former Bayern Munich defender suggests, with an increasingly cosmopolitan squad adopting a more cultural approach both on and off the field. Is the \"German mentality\" a myth? It depends who you ask and what you mean.  Both Schweinsteiger and Matth\u00e4us, Germany captains who have lift the coveted trophy, put their triumphs down to intangible qualities within the camp.  \"I would say it's to have a feeling for everyone -- to understand every single person, exactly how they are,\" says Schweinsteiger, when asked for the secret to Germany's success during his time in the side. \"Their character, their personality, which things they like, which they don't like. \"You have to oversee everything, which costs a lot of energy. But if you have experience and you know how to handle it, it's also kind of fun.\" It's an answer echoed by Matth\u00e4us, who also -- perhaps surprisingly -- singles out the importance of fun in the long weeks away.  \"First you need the quality of the players, the right system, but the team spirit is very important,\" the 1991 World Player of the Year explains.  \"From the first day we began preparation, two weeks before the World Cup, we had a feeling that we were working with 23 players together, and this is the most important thing. \"Not only in the final, not only when I got the cup -- generally the atmosphere in the team in the whole six, seven weeks when we were together was amazing. How we worked together, how we respected each other, how much fun we had. And then we had the results.\" Innovation German football identified a malaise, took the time to solve it, and is now reaping the rewards. But in such a competitive environment, complacency is the first step toward decline. \"For me, it goes around a little bit,\" muses Ziege. \"In my time, France was the country with the best young players. Then it dropped a bit to Spain, when they had their new ideas from Barcelona. Then we [Germany] had a problem and we changed everything. \"And now if you see the English teams just in the last six months, they have won a lot of trophies in the youth competitions.  Last November, Germany general manager Oliver Bierhoff admitted he was \"worried\" by the quality of England's youth, saying with the introduction of national football center St. George's Park, their rival is \"catching up.\" England, destitute in major tournaments since a solitary World Cup win back in 1966, lifted both the U17 and U20 World Cups in 2017, also triumphing at the U19 European Championships and U20 Toulon tournament.  \"It takes some time,\" said Bierhoff. \"We started in 2000 and the first result was in 2010 with new young, talented players.\" Matth\u00e4us isn't concerned about other nations replicating what Germany has done -- telling CNN Sport \"we copied France, we copied Switzerland!\"  But for Honigstein, there \"isn't really a model that can be copied, because you cannot translate it into countries.\" Instead, he contends it's \"a constant battle for innovation and keeping an edge.\" \"Germany, because of the numbers and underlying strength of the system, will always be one of the superpowers,\" Honigstein says. \"But they're working much harder than before in keeping that edge, wherever it may be: the tactical level or in terms of technology, which they used quite a lot at the last World Cup. \"And that battle, just as it is in club football, is just going to intensify as more and more federations wake up to the possibilities and challenges of international football.\"  Unity It's indicative of Germany's pedigree that they remain among the favorites despite flying to Russia on the back of just one win in six preparatory friendlies. \"I think Germany will play to win the World Cup,\" says Matth\u00e4us. \"We have really experienced players, we have talented players, we have good goalkeepers, we have good goalscorers, we have good midfielders, we have good defenders.\" Honigstein believes they can \"absolutely\" become the first team to retain the trophy for more than half a century, placing the Germans on a pedestal alongside France and Spain \"give or take a few percentage points,\" followed by Brazil.  Meanwhile Schweinsteiger, their fourth most capped player of all time, is quietly optimistic ahead of his first major tournament on the sidelines since 2002.  \"I hope that we can defend our title, but we will see -- it's never easy to play a World Cup,\" says the 33-year-old. \"We have a very strong team and I'm one of the biggest supporters!\"  For Matth\u00e4us, it's all about the strength of the collective. \"If you miss a player, it's very important you don't lose the overall quality in your team,\" he stresses. \"When [Lionel] Messi is injured for Argentina, Argentina is no longer Argentina.  \"I think you need players who are sitting on the bench that don't make problems sitting on it, but when they come on the field, they have the same quality as the player they replace.\" What are Germany's chances of retaining the World Cup?

{"content": "Historic Shinnecock lies among a swathe of big-money, uber-exclusive golf clubs at the eastern end of Long Island, but the private enclave welcomes the paying public for the year's second major this week. And for non-US players, the atmosphere generated by a raucous and patriotic New York crowd has been more akin to a bear pit than a cultured country club mixer. When Shinnecock hosted the last of its four US Opens in 2004, a quiet South African named Retief Goosen shook off personal abuse like water off a duck's back to win his second title. \"These guys are steely, but he was the iceman,\" Goosen's then caddie Colin Byrne, who now works with Spain's Rafa Cabrera-Bello, told CNN Sport. \"They were shouting insults to his face on the Sunday. It was quite hostile. That's something I might alert Rafa to -- the New York crowd aren't exactly the most welcoming to foreigners.\" READ: Dustin Johnson regains No.1 spot with walk-off eagle Goosen led by two on the Saturday night but became embroiled in a tense battle with home hero Phil Mickelson on a tumultuous and controversial final day. Elements of the crowd at Shinnecock weren't backward in telling Goosen what he should do and who they wanted to win. \"Guys were running up as he was coming off the green, shouting at him to three putt, or saying 'all yours to lose,' just nasty stuff and everything in his face,\" added Byrne, talking at the European Tour's flagship PGA Championship event at Wentworth to the southwest of London. \"There are two ways to deal with hostility -- either you back off it, or you embrace it and get stronger. The more they abused Retief the better he got. That was the worst thing they could have done.\" 'It was carnage' Conditions on the Sunday were brutal, with sun and strong winds rendering the course firm and fiery and making balls bound through greens, penalizing even seemingly good shots. Waiting outside the locker room, Byrne saw a succession of scoreboards come in with huge numbers -- \"12 over or 15 over\" -- and he realized they would have to change their perception of what a good score was. On the practice putting green, Byrne saw Goosen's playing partner Ernie Els' ball slide miles past his target hole.  \"I caught his eye and he looked at me as if to say, 'what is ahead of us?' It was carnage, the scores were outrageous,\" he says. The average score for the final round was 78.7, and no one was under par. \"The set up was so difficult, they didn't water it and it was verging on the farcical,\" said Byrne. \"It was unplayable at stages, that's why they had to water it halfway through the last round. It was certainly a tipping point.\"   Roared on by an increasingly vocal crowd, Masters champion Mickelson overhauled Goosen with birdies on 15 and 16 and the insults intensified. But the South African just fed off it and retook the lead on the 16th before parring home for a two-shot win. It was the third runner-up spot of Mickelson's now record six US Open seconds.    READ: Rory McIlroy exclusive: 'I know I can do better' 'Most important places' US Open organizer the United States Golf Association -- often criticized for the demanding nature of America's national championship -- came under fire for the course's set-up. USGA executive director Mike Davis admitted last month the body deserved a \"double bogey\" for how it handled the 2004 event. \"It was a different time, different people and we as an organization learned from it,\" he told reporters.  \"When you set up a US Open it is golf's ultimate test. It's set up probably closer to the edge than any other event in golf and I think the difference then versus now is we have a lot more technology, a lot more data in our hands. Frankly, what really happened then was just a lack of water.\" READ: The meeting with Tiger Woods 'I'll never forget' Shinnecock was built in 1891 and boasts the first golf clubhouse to be built in the US. It hosted the second US Open in 1896 and is \"one of the most important places in all of golf in the United States,\" according to Davis.  Club president Brett Picket told reporters Shinnecock was conceived \"when golf was just a cultural curiosity in America by some enthusiastic summer colonists who learned the game on their travels in Europe and thought these grounds were particularly well suited to it.\" The course, bounded by other exclusive Hampton icons such as Southampton Golf Club and the National Golf Links of America, overlooks the Peconic River and Shinnecock Bay and is as close to true links course as there is in the US. Wind is one of its main defences. \"I'm a believer that the difference between a soft, still US Open versus a firm and windy one could be as much as 20 strokes,\" said Davis. 'Ultimate test' The course will measure 7,445 yards this week, up about 500 yards on 2004 to bring earlier landing zones off tees back into play. In 1896 the course was 4,423 yards long.  Fairways have been widened in places and green complexes enlarged.  \"Shinnecock Hills is going to be a wonderful canvas to present that ultimate test,\" said Jeff Hall, the USGA's managing director of rules and Open Championships.  \"It's about testing the players' shotmaking, their golf course management skills and their mental and physical resolve. Make no mistake about it, the US Open is a grind. There's an emotional roller coaster there.\" Managing emotions and remaining in a \"state of zero, no ups or downs,\" while executing your carefully prepared strategy is the key, according to Byrne. Visit CNN.com/golf for more news, features and videos \"That's the perfect character for winning US Opens, not reacting badly to anything and just growing off it rather than crumbling from it,\" says Byrne, whose celebrations 14 years ago amounted to a couple of cans of beer from a petrol station while stuck in traffic heading back into New York.

Italy, the Netherlands and the United States are all watching from home, while World Cup first-timers Iceland and Panama look to make an impact.  The host nation, meanwhile, has emerged as perhaps the tournament's most controversial site since Argentina's military regime hosted in 1978. All sorts of questions have emerged ahead of the World Cup launch Thursday. Here's a look at some of the most intriguing ones: INTERACTIVE: World Cup in numbers SCHEDULE: Matches and kickoff times READ: Spain sacks coach after he takes Real Madrid job READ: US-Mexico-Canada win 2026 World Cup bid Now or never for Messi and Ronaldo With Ronaldo at 33 and Messi turning 31 this month, there is a feeling that both superstars won't get a better chance to capture the one major title that has evaded them.  True, this generation of elite athletes -- from Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, to Tom Brady and LeBron James -- is changing the rules of longevity.  But even if Messi and Ronaldo return for a farewell at Qatar 2022, the chances of either having a supporting cast of equal strength is low.  Ronaldo's Portugal is ranked world No. 4 by FIFA, coming off the high of winning Euro 2016, and aided by the emergence of 23-year-old Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva.  Messi's Argentina is just a notch behind at No. 5, returning strengthened after losing by an extra-time goal against Germany in the 2014 final.  Messi will operate the attack with veteran marksmen Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain -- both in their third World Cups -- and emerging 24-year-old Paulo Dybala.   A World Cup win for either Messi or Ronaldo could finally put to rest the debate of which of the two is the greatest ever. Or would it?  READ: 11 moments that shook the World Cup How do Germany and Brazil stack up?  Defending champion Germany returns with coach Joachim L\u00f6w and much of the same cast from the 2014 final -- minus Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Replacing them as team leaders are Real Madrid's Toni Kroos and Paris Saint-Germain's Julian Draxler. Look for super-sub \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan of Manchester City to make an impact.  Brazil, meanwhile, brought in manager Tite to replace Dunga. Under his wing, Brazil is playing with renewed freedom and has not lost in two years.  Neymar is fully fit and will be joined in attack by World Cup newcomers Gabriel Jesus and Philippe Coutinho, with Thiago Silva -- suspended in that 7-1 debacle against Germany in 2014 -- anchoring the back line. Twenty-five-year-old Roma goalkeeper Alisson Becker has been dubbed the \"Messi of keepers\" by a former coach. No pressure then.  READ: Russia 2018 to be World Cup of technology What are the most intriguing group matches? Portugal vs. Spain, June 15: It is rare to see two tournament favorites pitted in a group stage match. Spain will boast a veteran squad including David Silva (Manchester City), Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid) and Champions League bad boy Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid). Will Spain's captain Ramos be a little gentler covering Madrid teammate Cristiano Ronaldo? Don't count on it.  Argentina vs. Iceland, June 16: Messi and co. will start their campaign against the pesky darlings of Euro 2016. Argentina would be wise not to look at Iceland as a tuneup for Croatia and Nigeria.  Led by Everton's Gylfi Sigurdsson, the Icelanders will be looking to thunderclap their way back to another big upset after taking down England in the Euros.  Germany vs. Mexico, June 17: Look for CONCACAF champion Mexico -- led by a rejuvenated Javier Hernandez (West Ham) -- to pose a bigger threat to FIFA World No. 1 Germany after getting rolled over 4-1 in last year's Confederations Cup.  Egypt vs. Saudi Arabia, June 25: On that note, if Salah is able to provide even 20 quality minutes for Egypt after that bruising collision with Ramos in the Champions League final, he'll give the Pharaohs a big moral lift. But this match has ample intrigue off the pitch. Saudi, playing in its fifth World Cup since 1994, and African giant Egypt are both strong candidates to qualify for Qatar 2022. One small issue: The two are allies in an aggressive economic blockade against the Gulf emirate.  England vs. Belgium, June 28: Given this is the third group match for each team, one or both may have already qualified over Panama and Tunisia.  But Premier League fans will tune in for the sheer star power representing the league, including Belgians Eden Hazard (Chelsea), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City) and Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United), against England's Harry Kane (Tottenham), Raheem Sterling (Manchester City) and Jamie Vardy (Leicester City).  READ: And the winner of the 2018 World Cup will be ... Which young players could breakout in Russia?  Just 19, France's Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is one of the biggest names in world football -- and no stranger to pressure. Moving for a reported fee of more than $215 million last summer to Paris Saint-Germain, the Parisian responded with a solid 21-goal, 16-assist campaign. Operating alongside the likes of Paul Pogba will allow him room to maneuver in Russia.  Everyone knows about Salah, but 23-year-old Egyptian Mahmoud Hassan is a speedy winger coming off a 16-goal campaign in the Turkish League who may surprise foes. Hirving Lozano of Mexico notched 19 goals for PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch league. The pacy 22-year-old could create chaos for opponents if given the starting nod.  Twenty-year-old Ismaila Sarr of Senegal has been making an impact in France's Ligue 1. The dynamic forward has scored two goals in 10 international appearances, but has now cracked his way into his country's starting lineup.  Tottenham's Dele Alli is by no means a secret, but this could be his breakthrough moment on the international stage. The 22-year-old has scored just twice in 25 appearances for England but his near telepathic relationship with Spurs teammate Kane could prove crucial to his team's chances of success. READ: Your Country Needs You! What nationality means to the modern-day footballer What price the World Cup? Estimates for the total cost of hosting the World Cup range between $13.2 billion and $14 billion, according to Russian news reports.   They include costs for building or refitting 12 new stadiums, modernizing 20 railway stations, repairing 178 kilometers of roads and expanding airports in the 11 host cities.  The figures may seem high, and greatly exceed the $11 billion costs of Brazil's  2014 World Cup. But they are a drop in the ocean compared to Russia's cost of hosting the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. That total? $51 billion.  READ: How Australia kept fit on 250,000 km World Cup journey What are the biggest off-field talking points?  It's difficult to say whether any World Cup has had this much controversy before a ball has even been kicked, although Qatar 2022 could be a contender. British-Russian tension is at a recent high following the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in England in March. Both countries have since expelled diplomats, while the UK Foreign Office has issued a travel warning to its citizens, citing \"anti-British sentiment.\"  The Foreign Office also flagged the potential for discriminatory behavior in Russia against minorities and the LGBT community, an ongoing concern raised by several players in the run-up to the tournament.  Meanwhile, Britain is in no hurry to renew a visa for its highest-profile Russian resident -- Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.   Fanning the flames, former UK prime minister David Cameron -- a champion of England's losing 2018 World Cup bid -- suggested in April that Russia won its bid illicitly.  \"We wanted to lead the world in great sporting events that bring people together,\" he told a group at think tank Chatham House. \"Yet how did Russia end up winning the bid for the 2018 World Cup? I will let you fill in the blanks on that one.\" Any other business?  English pop star Robbie Williams will perform alongside Russian soprano Aida Garifullina half an hour before kickoff in the opening game between  Russia and Saudi Arabia in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium.  Calling the invitation a \"boyhood dream,\" Williams is urging fans \"to party with us in Russia ... for an unforgettable show.\" Brazilian 2002 World Cup winner Ronaldo -- who scored 15 goals over three tournaments -- will unveil the winner's trophy before the match.

{"content": "Time has passed at a painfully slow pace for the 50-year-old chauffeur, who moved to London from Portugal. And he isn't looking forward to Thursday, the first anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people and left a community homeless and heartbroken. \"That year it was so emotional all year round, but now is the worst time, because we have to remember everything,\" Alves told CNN in a temporary flat, where he lives with his wife, son and daughter. \"In one year, there's been such a lot of things to deal with. It looks like two or three years.\" Time is supposed to heal wounds, but for many Grenfell survivors and victims' relatives, the anniversary is a reminder of just how little has been put right over the past year. Alves, who spoke to CNN last year soon after the fire, is still trying to process what happened, though he knows he is one of the luckier ones. He and his wife were returning home from dinner in the early hours of June 14 last year, and as they pushed number 13 in the elevator to get to their apartment, someone else ran in as the doors were closing and pushed the button for the fourth floor.  It was there, low down in the 24-story building, that the fire had broken out, and it was during that quick stop that Alves and his wife saw and smelled the early signs of the blaze. Alves raced upstairs to get his daughter out of bed, and knocked on his neighbors' doors to warn them. He thinks constantly about what might have happened if he and his wife had gone straight up to their apartment and to bed, unaware of the fire below. \"Maybe I am not here to tell you the story,\" he said. \"We are religious, but my wife is very religious, and she believes it was a miracle.\" 'I will not have peace until I have the truth'   There are many stories of near misses like Alves', but there are also those of the 72 people who didn't make it. The public inquiry into the fire opened in earnest in late May with a week of testimony from family and friends to commemorate the dead. Each day began with 72 seconds of silence, and what ensued was a roller coaster of emotions -- grief, anger, and pride in the lives lived and then lost. Many victims came from abroad, moving to London in search of a better life. Among them was 23-year-old Syrian refugee Mohammad Al-Haj Ali, whose fianc\u00e9e, Amal, said in a video tribute: \"Right now when I think about my future, I don't really see anything.\" Mohammed Hakim lost all five members of his immediate family -- his mother, Rabia Begum, his father, Komru Miah, and his siblings, Husna Begum, Mohammed Hanif and Mohammed Hamid. His parents had immigrated to London from Bangladesh.  His siblings remained with their parents, who had mobility issues, as the fire engulfed their home. \"I can say with my hand on my heart that I am extremely proud of my family remaining close to each other in their last moments before passing away,\" Mohammed Hakim told the inquiry.   \"I am even more proud as a brother that my siblings did not leave my parents behind, even though they might have had the chance to escape.\" As the hearings went by, more and more families spoke of their fury and frustration -- much of it directed at those responsible for the combustible cladding used on the tower's facade, which appeared to have helped the blaze tear up the building's 24 stories so rapidly from the outside. But the London Fire Brigade's advice to residents to stay put for nearly two hours after the fire broke out has also come under scrutiny. Paulos Tekle, who moved to London from Ethiopia, was in his 18th floor apartment with his family during the fire. After being told by firefighters to stay in his apartment, he finally left almost two hours later when the fire brigade changed that advice and ordered an evacuation. He lost his 5-year-old son, Isaac, in the commotion.  He recalled the calmness with which Isaac had looked at him, trusting him to lead them to safety.    \"But I didn't, because I listened to the authorities. And that makes me angry. Are we not human? I have to live with the guilt of not protecting my son every day. I am broken. And now the only thing that can make me whole again is to fight for truth and justice in Isaac's name,\" he told the inquiry, breaking down in tears.  \"I will not have peace until I have the truth. I want to know why I was physically stopped from leaving the flat at about 2 a.m. Why were we kept inside for so long? What was responsible for such a decision? I want answers. If I had not listened to the fire brigade my son would have been likely alive today.\"   Laying blame The inquiry quickly turned from the passionate commemorative hearings to defensive statements by lawyers representing those accused of wrongdoing. Expert testimony is beginning to also shine a light on how the fire was able to take so many lives. As the chair of the inquiry, retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said at the opening, the proceedings aim to \"provide answers to the pressing questions of how a disaster of this kind could occur in 21st century London.\" Fire safety expert Barbara Lane submitted a damning report detailing several breaches of building regulations at almost every level. Among her findings was that cladding around the building was combustible and \"non-compliant\" with building regulations, producing toxic smoke that impeded firefighters in reaching residents. The front doors of apartments that were supposed to keep fire and smoke out failed. All were non-compliant with fire-safety regulations, including more than 100 that had been replaced in 2011, Lane found. The stairway fire doors were also below standard.  A fire lift did not operate as it should have, and the building was not fitted with a water source, as required under UK safety standards, to aid firefighters responding to higher floors. Britain typically uses a passive approach to fire response, which means residents often \"stay put\" in their apartments as firefighters try to compartmentalize a blaze.  Lane also raised concerns as to why it took nearly two hours for the fire brigade to drop its stay put advice and call for an evacuation, when, she said, the initial advice had \"effectively failed\" within around half an hour. Police are also investigating this procedure.  But Lane conceded that changing the response strategy was no easy decision, and the London Fire Brigade has defended its decisions in the inquiry. A lawyer for the fire service, Stephen Walsh, said that the firefighters \"will have been wholly unaware of defects in the fabric of the building from a fire safety perspective.\" The union's Martin Seaward said while there was concern over the stay put policy, there was \"no obvious and safe alternative strategy\" to deal with the fire, and he asked the inquiry not to be swayed by the \"benefit of hindsight.\" But most of the anger has been directed to the Kensington and Chelsea Council and the borough's Tenant Management Organization (TMO). Former Grenfell residents say their complaints about safety and conditions in the tower were repeatedly ignored by the organization and council. The TMO told the inquiry that it acknowledged its central role in Grenfell Tower's refurbishment, as well as the management of fire safety issues there.   \"It accepts its involvement will, and should, come under great scrutiny,\" it said. But it added that it had relied on contractors with expertise of building practices to ensure safety. \"While (the TMO) is a specialist in the management of social housing stock, it is not a specialist construction company and so, when it commissioned the large-scale refurbishment project at Grenfell Tower in 2012, it had to engage specialist contractors to carry out the work, and consultants to advise on regulatory and building compliance, including fire safety issues.\" A place called home Grenfell Tower now stands in Kensington as a relic, covered in scaffolding and white sheets like a bandage over broken bones. On it is a banner of green heart and the words \"GRENFELL, FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS.\"  Replacing those homes has been a frustratingly long process. British Prime Minister Theresa May said after the fire that every resident would be rehoused in three weeks. A year on, the majority of people are still not in a permanent home. The council says 203 were needed in total, and that while almost all residents have agreed to some type of new accommodation, it admits that only 82 new permanent homes are now in use.  That leaves the rest of the residents still in temporary accommodation, including 69 emergency homes.  Yvette Williams from the group Justice4Grenfell said the fact that so many people are still in emergency housing a year on was a sign that things have moved far too slowly. She said new housing had been offered to many of the displaced in boroughs that are too far away, and some have complained that the accommodation offered to them is unsuitable. \"It's a year on, and what are the local authorities doing? They did no needs-analysis on what the survivors actually wanted, they just bought properties for them to live in ad hoc. There are large numbers of people with mobility and disability issues who are living a ridiculous number of floors up,\" she said. \"When you look at Grenfell, you see everything that's wrong with society -- people being treated like second-class citizens, cost-cutting, inequality, greed. The government has to put in legislation that makes sure people are not treated that way ever again. Social housing isn't a privilege, it's a right.\" Council leader Elizabeth Campbell denied that a large number of homes were not ready for people to move into, saying 90% of the homes offered could be used now.  \"The families involved are not statistics that need to be moved around a balance sheet. So, we will no longer set deadlines. They are not required. What is required is understanding, support, and above all a willingness to do everything we can to help. No matter how large or small the task,\" Campbell said in a statement to CNN. \"We continue to look at the barriers to moving into a new home, but we all have to accept that one of the barriers is trust in the council itself -- that is something we understand, and accept, and it will take time to rebuild.\"  Theresa Griffin agrees that trust has been well and truly broken. She and her daughter live in Bramley House, in Grenfell Tower's shadow, and both lost friends in the fire. Griffin has been maintaining a small memorial near the tower at the Latymer Christian Center, a place of support and donations to victims. A year on, the teddy bears and toy bunny rabbits have faded in color, but people continue to bring fresh flowers and candles to remember those lost.  Asked about what justice for Grenfell means, Griffin said that money was the cause of what happened at Grenfell and that money was not what will heal wounds. Like many people affected by the fire, she is not convinced the public inquiry will make things right. Plenty of inquiries in the UK have taken years on end, and have concluded with little action taken. \"It would mean something if they admitted everything that went wrong,\" she said. \"But the corporate ones who had a foot in Grenfell will never spend a day in jail.\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/13/uk/grenfell-tower-fire-no-justice-intl/index.html", "description": "Time is said to heal wounds, but for many Grenfell Tower fire survivors, the one-year anniversary is a reminder of how little has been put right.", "title": "Grenfell Tower: Still no justice a year on from the fire", "author": "Angela Dewan, CNN\nPhotos by Sarah Tilotta for CNN \nVideo by Muhammad Darwish, CNN", "date": "2018-06-13 04:04:07"},
{"content": "Here's a handy guide on who to root for, if you have no one to pledge allegiance to. If you think soccer is too slow ...  ... keep an eye on France. France is all about pace when it has the ball, not just with its goal scorers, but through midfield and even with its outside backs.  They have winger Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who has reached speeds Usain Bolt would be jealous of.  There are also the young lions from England. Maybe they are too young -- third youngest team in the tournament -- to know better.  If you're a sucker for an underdog ... ... go with Senegal, because Liverpool forward Sadio Mane could emerge as a World Cup star. Senegal has only been to the finals once (2002), where it dumped defending champ France in group play and made it to the quarters.  If you believe there's an 'i' in 'Team' ... ... then Mo Salah of Egypt is probably going to be your guy. Just like some folks look at the Cleveland Cavaliers as  LeBron and four other dudes on the court, they view Egypt the same way. It's Mo Salah and 10 other guys. Salah is a budding legend, he scored like a thousand goals in matches he played this season for English Premier League side Liverpool before he was injured in the Champions League final. (And maybe LeBron is cheering for him. The NBA's marquee man is a part owner in Liverpool.)  If you base your picks on who looks sharp ... .... then dang, Brazil makes yellow look good. The yellow jerseys were designed to match the color of the 1970 uniform when Brazil, led by Pele, easily won the Cup.   There's also Croatia; the players sport a red and white chessboard on their chests. And for something really different,  Nigeria's home jersey looks like there was an explosion at the lime green highlighter factory.  If you like a badass nickname ... ... you have to admit Lions of Persia is pretty cool. That's the unofficial nickname for Iran (the official is Team Melli -- The National Team. Boooring.) Nigeria's Super Eagles of Nigeria and Tunisia's Eagles of Carthage have boss names, too. If you're all about die hard fandom ...  ... then look no further than Iceland. Its fan base is crazy enthusiastic. When Iceland played in the European Championships two years ago, more than one in 10 citizens went to the finals. And Iceland has the most awesome cheer: A Viking clap that's kinda like that cliched clap in the movies after someone's heartfelt speech: it starts slow, then gets faster until the crowd explodes with joy.  If you just want to spout fun facts ... ... then you can bang with Belgium.  Belgium has played in 12 World Cups and never won -- but this could be the year! It has a cool nickname (the Red Devils) and the players wear cool jerseys (vivid red with argyle). Captain Vincent Kompany recently acquired a MBA.It has a fantastic goalscorer Romelu Lukaku who was one of the most expensive players ever on the club team transfer market. And it has one of the best players of the world in a man named Hazard -- Eden Hazard. If you want to see the most creative dives ... ... Hmm, that's a tough one. Most teams have a player or two -- or three --  who'll flop and preen and play-act like babies, hoping to get a little help from the ref. You'll just have to watch. And so will the video assistant referees, working the World Cup for the first time. If you only want to support a team that is #Winning ... ... hedge your bets on Germany. Die Mannschaft is ranked No. 1 and blitzed its way through qualifying, scoring a huge number of goals.

{"content": "At a FIFA association member vote in Moscow Wednesday, the joint North American bid won the right to host the 2026 World Cup, comfortably beating rivals Morocco in the vote.  It will be the first time the World Cup will be shared by three host nations, but since the unified bid was announced in April 2017 political relationships between the US and its proposed co-hosts have been touchy at times. US President Donald Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \"meek and mild\" in a tweet over a tariff dispute following a G7 meeting earlier in June, while tariffs imposed on Mexico along with plans for a border wall have also ruffled feathers south of the border. Soon after the result was announced, Trump tweeted: \"The U.S., together with Mexico and Canada, just got the World Cup. Congratulations - a great deal of hard work!\" INTERACTIVE: World Cup in numbers READ: The secrets to Germany's World Cup success READ: Spain sacks coach after he takes Real Madrid job The United Bid promises to bring all three nations closer together for what will be the largest edition of the tournament to date -- 48 countries will compete -- and the most lucrative. The North American bid's revenue forecast was $14.3 billion, with a record profit of $11 billion for FIFA, the sport's governing body. \"Hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup is a rare and important moment to demonstrate that we are all truly united through sport,\" said Carlos Cordeiro, President of US Soccer and Co-Chair of the United Bid, in Moscow.  The last time the US hosted a men's World Cup was in 1994, and Mexico in 1986. Canada has never previously hosted World Cup matches, though it has staged a women's World Cup. READ: From headbutts to the 'Hand of God': 11 moments that shook the World Cup Russia votes for North American bid The vote, in which all FIFA associations were, for the first time, eligible to vote for the host, was cast at the 68th FIFA Congress on the eve of the 2018 edition of the tournament, which begins Thursday. The United Bid won by a 134-65 margin, with one vote for \"neither\" host. Seven federations -- the four bidding nations along with three US dependent territories -- recused themselves. After the controversial award of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to Russia and Qatar respectively, FIFA promised a \"more open and transparent\" vote this time.   Previous hosts had been decided by the FIFA Executive committee, now known as the FIFA Council.  Russia voted for the North American bid, as did South Africa -- the only African nation to host a World Cup.  Football powerhouses Brazil, Italy, the Netherlands and France backed the losing bid, as did China, while Iran was the country that voted for \"neither,\" while Spain, Slovenia and Cuba abstained.  Under the North America proposal, 60 of the tournament's matches will be held in the US, including everything from the quarterfinals onwards, while Mexico and Canada will host 10 games each. Fraught relations As well as trade tensions, there had also been worries that President Trump's travel ban blocking immigration from several Muslim-majority countries -- which is being challenged in the US Supreme Court -- could affect fans, officials and players. However, Trump has promised FIFA that foreign teams, officials and fans will be able to travel to the US.  The United bid shared with CNN Sport a letter sent to FIFA in March by the US government which said it \"intends to issue visas, subject to eligibility under U.S. law, without regard to race, skin color, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, disability, wealth, birth or any other status, or sexual orientation.\" The statement said that the bid organizers were confident that \"every eligible fan and member of our FIFA family will have unhindered access to our country to experience and celebrate the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\" And despite political differences, the World Cup bid has given the US, Canada and Mexico a common cause, with the North American bid having received the full support of their governments.  Indeed, Trump courted controversy in April with comments made about the vote. \"The US has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup,\" Trump tweeted. \"It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. \"Why should we be supporting these countries when they don't support us (including at the United Nations)?\"  The tweet caused FIFA to direct attention to the organization's ethics rules governing the bid process and \"to the Bid Rules of Conduct incorporated therein,\" a spokesman said. READ: How Diego Maradona redefined football in the space of less than five minutes One-sided race The outcome of the vote had been expected, despite a tightening of the race in recent days.  Ahead of Wednesday's ballot, the \"United\" bid from North America came out on top in a FIFA evaluation, with various aspects including stadiums, accommodation, transport and organizing costs factored in.  Out of five, the joint bid got a score of four, while the Moroccan bid scored just 2.7, with the North African bid deemed \"high risk\" in three areas because of a lack of infrastructure to host the 80-game tournament.  The United Bid also estimated double the profits that the Morocco bid had calculated -- $10 billion to $5 billion for the North African nation.  Morocco had said it needed to spend almost $16 billion (\u00a312 billion) on infrastructure while the North American bid's revenue forecast ($14.3bn) far outstripped what Morocco had to offer ($7.2bn). READ: Vincent Kompany: 'Pele is the greatest player of all time' In addition to its low evaluation score, FIFA's evaluation of the Morocco bid also raised concerns about the potential treatment of the LGBT community.  \"There is a risk of discrimination based on sexual orientation as a consequence of the country's legislation on the matter,\" the FIFA assessment said.
